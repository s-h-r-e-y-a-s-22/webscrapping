"Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid After 200 years of neutrality, Sweden is set to join the alliance, but plenty of questions remain.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66162513,"– Turkey argued Sweden was giving refuge to Kurdish militants, and needed to do more to crack down on rebel groups like the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which it considers a terrorist organization.) Like any of NATO's 31 member countries, Turkey has the power to block new nations from joining the group. This is a historic moment for Sweden, which has spent the past year fighting hard to get accepted into NATO. The Nordic country previously embraced wartime neutrality for more than 200 years, but applied for membership last May as part of efforts to improve security and stability in northern Europe, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The outcome of crunch talks with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is being seen as a major win for Sweden's right-wing Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson.",Positive

Trump seeks to delay classified documents trial Lawyers for the former US president argue a December trial would deny them reasonable time to prepare.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66162668,"– Donald Trump has asked for his trial on charges of illegally stashing classified documents to be postponed until after the 2024 election. In a filing on Monday, lawyers for the former US president said a proposed trial date of 11 December would deny them reasonable time to prepare.They also cited challenges in finding an impartial jury due to the election.Mr Trump pleaded not guilty to 37 counts during an arraignment in Miami, Florida last month.The Department of Justice has not commented on the latest filing, which applies both to Mr Trump and his aide Walt Nauta who has also pleaded not guilty in the case.The trial date was initially set for 14 August, but it was later postponed until 11 December to give both sides more time to prepare.Mr Trump is facing 37 counts, including wilful retention of national defense information and obstruction of justice.According to the indictment, Mr Trump directed Mr Nauta to move boxes that were a focus of the investigation from a storage room at the resort.Mr Nauta, who was indicted at the same time as Mr Trump, has denied six charges, including conspiracy and making false statements.Mr Trump's lawyers describe the case as ""extraordinary"" and argue the amount of evidence that needs to be reviewed warrants a delay.They argue it will be ""challenging"" to prepare for the trial before the presidential election in November 2024, for which Mr Trump is the frontrunner to win the Republican nomination.Mr Trump's legal team then ask the federal court in Florida to hold off altogether on setting a new date for criminal proceedings to begin.The government's request to begin a trial of this magnitude within six months of indictment is unreasonable, telling, and would result in a miscarriage of justice.",Negative
