The children left injured and starving in Yemen's forgotten war The BBC's Orla Guerin meets families living in fear of snipers and children who have been maimed by mines.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-66258171,"– In September 2014, the Houthis seized Yemen's capital, Sanaa, driving out the government. The following spring a Saudi-led coalition intervened, backed by the UK and the US. Eight years, and thousands of coalition air strikes later, the Houthis still hold the capital. But on the front lines in Taiz, Bader and Hashim still sleep and wake to the sound of warfare. ""I hear explosions,"" says Bader, ""and there are snipers. They shoot everything in the neighborhood. I feel like there could be an explosion near me, or the house could be blown up."" In a small voice, sounding younger than his nine years, Hashim says he would like to go back to school. But my leg has been cut off, so how can I go?"" Their father says they have not been enrolled for the upcoming school year because he has no money for transport. The boys were hit by Houthi shelling on an October morning last year as they came home from school on a break, according to their father, al-Harbi Nasser al-Majnahi.",Negative
Capitol rioter who beat officer with flag jailed Footage shows Peter Francis Stager assaulting a fallen Capitol police officer with an American flag.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66301561,"– A man who used the pole of an American flag to batter a fallen police officer during the US Capitol attack has received a 52-month jail term. Peter Francis Stager helped drag the officer down the steps of the Capitol, then ""forcibly and repeatedly"" struck him, say prosecutors. Stager, a 44-year-old truck driver from Conway, Arkansas, pleaded guilty in February to a felony charge of assaulting police with a dangerous weapon. He was identified six days after the attack by an informant, who told the FBI he recognized Stager from videos posted on Twitter. Government prosecutors had previously argued ""Stager's chilling motivation and the brutality of the assault"" called for a prison sentence of six years and six months.

"How desperate US prisoners try to escape deadly heat With no air con, a former prisoner describes lying in toilet water to survive brutal heat.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66274629,"– As temperatures rise, prisoners locked in cells without air conditioning—and the staff guarding them—are struggling. Calvin Johnson spent 37 years in a Texas state prison, including 37 summers in a jail cell with no air conditioning. On the countless blisteringly hot days, when temperatures climbed above 37.7C (100F), his survival depended upon a mix of creativity and desperation to stay cool—stay alive. The increasing frequency of dangerously hot conditions has drawn renewed attention to US prisons and calls for reform. Thirteen states in the hottest parts of the US—including Texas and Arizona—lack universal air conditioning in prisons, according to an analysis by the Prison Policy Initiative, creating deadly conditions. Johnson said he even saw some inmates drinking water from the toilet because it was a few degrees cooler than what came from the cell's sink. Of the 100 prisons operated by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, 31 are fully air-conditioned and 55 have air-conditioning limited to certain areas. Since mid-June, at least nine prisoners have died of reported heart attacks or cardiac events in un-cooled Texas prisons where the outdoor heat indices were above 100 degrees, the Texas Tribune reported. TDCJ spokesperson Amanda Hernandez said it was inaccurate to label any death as heat-related before an investigation is complete. To describe what it's like in a prison where triple-digit temperatures fill the air, he said: ""It's like working in an inferno.""",Negative

Is Musk right to ditch the Twitter bird logo? Rebrands can pay off - but it's a risky move to replace a famous icon at an organisation in turmoil.,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66296468,"– One of the most recognizable logos on the web, the tweeting blue bird, is no more. Will the black and white X replacing it prove to be a masterstroke or a branding disaster? When Jean-Pierre Dube saw the news that Elon Musk was scrapping Twitter's logo in favor of an Art Deco-style X, the marketing professor thought it was a joke. ""Why take a recognized brand, with a lot of brand capital around it and then completely throw it away and start from scratch?"" said Prof Dube, who teaches at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. But in the long term, could it work? Mr Musk's takeover of Twitter last year has been punishing for the social media platform. Advertising revenue has dropped by half, Mr Musk said this month, as big brands pulled back, wary of changes he has made, including how the firm handles verified accounts and moderates content.",Negative
