"Canada wants US workers - and they are interested A Canadian work permit for US H1-B visa holders hit its cap of 10,000 applicants in only 48 hours.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66249400,"– When Leon Yang was 16, he moved by himself from Xi'An, China to the US, to study in a country where he believed that, if he worked hard every day, he could get where he wanted. The H1-B allows foreign-born, US-educated individuals to work in the country for three to six years, but requires sponsorship by an employer and often provides no meaningful path to permanent residency. This week, Mr Yang, now 25, submitted his application for a new Canadian program that offers open work permits, for up to three years, to H1-B visa holders and their immediate family members. The measure, a temporary effort to attract skilled and high-tech US workers to the country, only opened on Monday morning. It remains to be seen whether Canada will extend the cap for its work permit program or seek to make it permanent. When it was established by the US Congress in the year 1990, only 65,000 foreign nationals could apply for the visa each year. That limit has since been raised only once - to 85,000 - which Ms Zavodny says is ""way too small."" Ron Hira, a research associate with the non-partisan Economic Policy Institute think tank, says the H1-B program is ""a mixed bag"" that sometimes rewards ""the best and brightest"" but largely benefits workers with skills already abundantly available in the US. He warns that it is far too early to know if Canada has made a good decision, in spite of the optics, and points to its lack of screening criteria for the open work permit as well as mass layoffs in spite of the optics, and says the US is losing graduates of its own universities who want to stay but are forced to return to their home countries or go elsewhere for employment.",Positive

Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships Russia announces it will treat ships heading for Ukrainian ports as potential military targets.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66253143,"– Russia pulled out of a UN deal on Monday that ensured safe passage for grain shipments crossing the Black Sea. Moscow also warned that from Thursday any ships going there would be seen as siding with ""the Kyiv regime."" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of deliberately targeting grain export infrastructure and putting vulnerable countries at risk.Wheat prices have risen sharply on global markets after Russia said it would treat ships heading for Ukrainian ports as potential military targets.Moscow also warned that from Thursday all vessels sailing on the Black Sea to Ukrainian ports would be regarded as ""potential carriers of military cargo"" and that the ships' ""flag states... will be considered to be involved in the Ukrainian conflict on the side of the Kyiv regime.""On Wednesday Mr Putin accused the West of using the grain deal as ""political blackmail.""Ukraine's options for exporting grain by rail are also very limited: rail capacity is smaller than shipping volumes and several EU countries in Eastern Europe are blocking Ukrainian grain, in order to protect their own farmers.Mr Putin said he would return to the international grain agreement immediately if his demands were met.",Negative
Xi meets Kissinger as US seeks to defrost China ties The 100-year-old diplomat's surprise trip to Beijing follows a flurry of visits by US officials.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-66106076,"– Chinese president Xi Jinping has given a warm welcome to former top diplomat Henry Kissinger, as the US pursues closer ties with China. State television showed Mr Xi smiling as he told Mr Kissinger: ""I'm very glad to see you, sir."" They met at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, a more intimate space than the sprawling Great Hall of the People where official meetings with foreign diplomats are usually hosted. Diaoyutai was also the place where, half a century ago, Mr Kissinger met Chinese officials in a secret visit that helped to kick-start the normalisation of US-China ties, noted Mr Xi. With its overtly warm reception of Mr Kissinger, Beijing has clearly signaled it wants more engagement from the US, with Mr Wang saying ""the US' China policy needs Kissinger's diplomatic wisdom and Nixon's political courage."" But this will not change the fact that China will, in the end, stick to its priorities, said Wen-ti Sung, a political scientist with the Australian National University.",Positive
Police search for suspected lioness in Berlin area Residents in the south-western outskirts of Berlin are being told to stay indoors.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66254908,"– Police are searching for an animal they believe is a lioness in the south-western outskirts of Berlin. A police spokeswoman said they received calls and a video alerting them to the wild animal at about midnight on Wednesday, and immediately began their search. Residents are being told to stay indoors until it is found. Kleinmachnow Mayor Michael Grubert said authorities have not been able to verify the initial reports of the animal sighting, but it has since been seen by an officer involved in the search. A video shared on Twitter - which police believe is real - also appeared to show a lioness in a forest in Kleinmachnow. However, it is unclear where the animal came from. Police spokesperson Daniel Keip told public broadcaster RBB that ""in the summer you often hear reports of crocodiles in swimming lakes and then it turns out all it was, was a big duck. In this case it's obviously totally real.",Positive
Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66252781,"– Two Internal Revenue Service investigators have testified to Congress that the investigation into Hunter Biden's tax returns were hampered by justice department officials for political reasons. They allege that Mr Biden, who agreed on 20 June to plead guilty to two misdemeanour tax offences and a felony firearm violation, should have been charged with more serious crimes. Instead, they claim, he received more lenient treatment because he is the son of US President Joe Biden. The two IRS employees who testified about the Hunter Biden investigation are Gary Shapley, a supervisory special agent, and Joseph Zielger, a criminal investigator. The two whistleblowers accuse Delaware Assistant US Attorney Lesley Wolf, an assistant to Mr Weiss, of repeatedly blocking further investigation into Hunter Biden. They say she denied a request for a search warrant of Joe Biden's Wilmington home, where Hunter Biden kept some of his financial records, citing ""optics."" Shapley has worked for the IRS for 14 years and serves as a team leader in the agency's International Tax and Financial Crimes group, which oversaw the IRS investigation into Hunter Biden.",Negative

Astonishing new finds in the ancient city of Pompeii,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66226417,"– A kitchen shrine adorned with serpents, a bakery, human skeletons, exquisite frescos, and yes, a picture of something that looks very much like pizza.) Dig anywhere in the ancient city destroyed by Mount Vesuvius in AD79 and you will unearth a treasure—a snapshot of a lost Roman world. It's extraordinary to think that one-third of the city buried under pumice and ash has yet to be excavated. BBC News has been given exclusive access to the investigation with Lion TV, which is making a three-part series to be aired early next year on the BBC. The latest work returns to a sector in the park last explored in the late 19th Century. Back then, archaeologists had opened up the frontage of houses on Via Di Nola, one of Pompeii's main thoroughfares, but hadn't delved far behind. Now, the diggers are progressively pulling away the volcanic ash and pea-sized stones, known as lapilli, that smothered Pompeii during the two catastrophic days of the Vesuvian eruption.",Negative
Severe storms blow debris across US highway,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66251719,"– It's been a rough year for US-Mexico relations, but the two countries have come together to create a plan to mend their differences—or at least avoid a full-scale war.
