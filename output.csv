"Can US and China set aside rivalry for climate action? The two biggest economies and polluters need to work together to avert the crisis, experts say.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-66185535,"– John Kerry's office says he wants to engage with China on ""increasing implementation and ambition"" and ensuring a successful COP28, the UN climate change conference scheduled for the end of the year. But they are also the world's two largest carbon emitters, making them the ""G2 of energy consumption, energy use and pollution,"" noted Dan Kammen, energy professor at the University of California, Berkeley. The two countries are the biggest investors in renewable energy, with China alone making up more than half of the world's total renewable energy investment, according to one assessment. But they are also the world's two largest carbon emitters, making them the ""G2 of energy consumption, energy use and pollution,"" noted Dan Kammen, energy professor at the University of California, Berkeley. China has now shifted to prioritising its energy security. Last year, China approved a dramatic increase in its coal power output, the equivalent of approving two large coal power plants a week, according to one analysis. Analysts say Mr Kerry may try to persuade China to fully capitalize on its clean energy resources and achieve carbon neutrality more quickly. China aims to peak its carbon emissions by 2030 and become carbon neutral by 2060— goals which some say are too far off and give it too much leeway. Earlier this month Ms Yellen urged Beijing to donate to international climate funds set up by richer countries to help poorer economies struggling with climate change.",Positive
Why Hollywood actors have walked off set,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66208226,"– The last time both writers and actors manned the picket line, the strike lasted 10 weeks and was led by then-actor Ronald Reagan.

What prompted the end of Britpop?,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-66186676,"– Britpop was coined by journalist Stuart Maconie in a long polemic about the state of guitar music in the April 1993 issue of Select magazine.The movement was often framed as a push back against the dreary self-seriousness of US grunge, with bands drawing consciously on the tradition of melodic, guitar-based British pop established by the Beatles, and spicing it up with elements of glam and punk rock.It was a rallying call, for sure, but the movement didn't burst into life straight away—perhaps because, in addition to Britpop, Maconie insisted on calling these bands ""the bulletproof Jolenests.""But the scene really came together a year later.In the space of two weeks, Blur released Parklife, Oasis put out their debut single, Supersonic, and Pulp issued their breakthrough album His 'N' Hers. Britpop dominated the musical landscape so definitively that bands felt confident enough to play at Knebworth.But almost as soon as it arrived, Britpop fizzled out.In a new BBC Sounds series, The Rise And Fall of Britpop, Jarvis Cocker explains, ""Britpop had this euphoria of thinking, 'Yeah, we're the snotty kids and we're finally getting to go center stage.' Then everybody was drinking too much and getting a hangover—and then, of course, people don't want to buy records by hungover people.""",Positive
