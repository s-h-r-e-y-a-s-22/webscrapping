Why is US giving Ukraine 'abhorrent' cluster bombs? This hideous weapon is banned by more than 100 countries - so the move will likely draw intense criticism.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66133527,"– The US has announced it is complying with a Ukrainian request to supply it with controversial cluster munitions. The move is likely to draw intense criticism from human rights groups as the weapon is banned by more than 100 countries. cluster munitions are a method of dispersing large numbers of tiny bomblets from a rocket, missile, or artillery shell that scatters them in mid-flight over a wide area. They are intended to explode on impact but a significant proportion are ""duds"", meaning they don't explode initially—this happens especially if they land on wet or soft ground. They can then explode at a later date on being picked up or trodden on, killing or maiming the victim. Ukraine's forces are running desperately low on artillery shells, largely because, like the Russians, they use them up at an extraordinarily high rate and Ukraine's Western allies cannot replace them at the rate they are needed. cluster munitions are a hideous, indiscriminate weapon that is banned in much of the world for good reason. This US move will inevitably place it somewhat at odds with its Western allies and any perceived split in that alliance is exactly what President Vladimir Putin wants and needs.",Negative
