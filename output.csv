Ukraine's membership on the agenda at Nato summit But the meeting in Lithuania will see disagreement on what to promise President Zelensky.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66157625,"– NATO leaders are gathering in Lithuania for a crucial summit that could shape the direction of the war in Ukraine and the future of the Western alliance. They arrive with a welcome boost after Turkey dropped its objections to Sweden joining the alliance. But after late night talks on Monday, he announced that Turkey had agreed to support Sweden's application to join NATO. On the membership issue, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wants Nato to say Ukraine could join as soon as possible after the fighting ends - setting out explicitly how and when this could be achieved. But some Nato nations are reluctant to go too far, fearing the promise of near-automatic membership could give Russia an incentive both to escalate and drag out the war. Over their two-day summit, Nato leaders are expected to agree new plans to deter and defend the alliance against future Russian aggression by beefing up their forces in the east. Some Nato members will promise Ukraine new security guarantees. But perhaps most importantly, some members are expected to set out more explicitly Ukraine's pathway to joining the alliance.",Positive
Palestinian boy shot in Jenin was unarmed - family It comes after videos emerge of the moment the 16-year-old was killed during an Israeli assault.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-66153159,"– Israel said all the Palestinians who were killed were combatants. But the videos show Abdul Rahman Hassan Ahmad Hardan, 16, was unarmed when he was shot. The teenager was shot in the head outside al-Amal hospital on the second day of the military incursion, which Israel said was intended to root out a ""safe haven of terrorism"" in Jenin refugee camp. Israel Defense Forces spokesman Lt Col Richard Hecht, asked by the BBC last week about the casualties, said: ""There were 12 people killed, every one that was killed was involved directly with terrorism."" After his death, Abdul Rahman Hardan was claimed as a member by the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad. But his family has distanced itself from the claim, and Israel has yet to show evidence he posed a threat at the time he was fatally shot. Under international law, the use of firearms by security forces against civilians is defined as a measure of last resort, and can only take place to stop an ""imminent threat of death or serious injury.""",Negative
