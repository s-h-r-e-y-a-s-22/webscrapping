A Wagner fighter reveals his part in the mutiny A junior commander says lower-ranking mercenaries had no idea what was happening during the rebellion.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66247915,"– A mercenary who took part in the attempted mutiny against Russian President Vladimir Putin says he and his fellow fighters ""didn't have a clue"" what was going on. In the space of just 24 hours, the leader of the Wagner Group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, staged an insurrection, sending troops into the southern city of Rostov, then further on towards Moscow. Wagner fighters rarely talk to the media, but BBC Russian spoke to a junior commander who found himself in the middle of the action. Gleb—not his real name—had previously been involved in the fighting for the symbolic town of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine. Early in the morning on 23 June they got the call to join a column of Wagner fighters leaving Ukraine. The order came from a Wagner commander who Gleb is reluctant to name for security reasons, but who was acting on orders from Prigozhin and the Wagner Command Council. Gleb says no one was told where the column was heading, but he was surprised when he realized they were moving away from the frontline. The Wagner fighters encountered absolutely no resistance, he says, as they crossed the Russian border into the Rostov region. Gleb confirms media reports that this column was led by Wagner founder Dmitry Utkin, a former special forces officer who is rarely seen in public. Gleb was contacted by one of his superiors and told, without any explanation, that he and his unit should now return to base in Luhansk.",Positive
Spain faces left-right divide in hot summer vote Resurgent nationalists in Spain aim to roll back the left-wing coalition's reforms.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66258206,"– Spaniards go to the polls on Sunday in a general election that offers a choice of two starkly contrasting visions. Socialist Pedro Snchez has been prime minister since 2018. He hopes his government's social reforms, crisis management and handling of a strongly performing economy will persuade voters to keep him in office. But his party has been lagging in polls behind the conservative People's Party led by Alberto Nez Feijo, who may end up needing far-right support. This is the first Spanish general election of modern times held in the searing heat of mid-summer, when many Spaniards are on holiday. Mr Feijo, 61, caused controversy during the campaign by appearing to cast doubt on the management of postal votes, which has surged to around 2.5 million. Polling for the rest of Spain's 37 million voters takes place from 09:00 to 20:00 (07:00-18:00 GMT).",Positive
Cambodia leader faces no challengers at election Voters going to the ballots say they are certain Hun Sen's ruling party will sweep all seats again.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66264726,"– Voting is underway in Cambodia, where the country's long-term leader is virtually certain to extend his party's rule in an election where there are no serious challengers. People turning up to the polls in Phnom Penh told the BBC they expected the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) to sweep all 125 seats in parliament again. Hun Sen, who has been in power for 38 years, faces no real challenge after the only credible opposition party was disqualified in May. But the poll comes as Hun Sen, who cast his vote in the capital early on Sunday morning, shows the clearest signals yet that he's planning to hand power to his eldest son, Hun Manet—possibly within weeks. Hun Sen has become increasingly authoritarian in his rule, political analysts say. Earlier this year, leading opposition figure Kem Sokha was sentenced to 27 years prison on alleged treason charges, and key news outlet Voice of Democracy shut down. Hun Sen's party has won all six of the national elections held every five years since the 1990s, when the UN helped the Southeast Asian nation of 16 million people become a functioning democracy post decades of civil war and the murderous Khmer Rouge regime. But the poll comes as Hun Sen, who cast his vote in the capital early on Sunday morning, shows the clearest signals yet that he's planning to hand power to his eldest son, Hun Manet—possibly within weeks.",Negative
Crimea bridge closed after fuel depot hit - Russia Russian-installed authorities halt railway services in Crimea and say Ukraine was behind a drone strike.,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-66276788,"– A drone attack on an ammunition depot in Crimea has led to civilian evacuations and disrupted transport, Russian authorities have said. Sergei Aksyonov, the Russian-installed governor of occupied Crimea, said Ukraine was behind the attack, without providing evidence. The bridge, often referred to as the Crimea bridge, was opened in 2018 enabling road and rail access between Russia and Crimea - Ukrainian territory annexed by Moscow in 2014. It has become a symbol of Russian occupation and is also an important re-supply route for Russian forces in southern Ukraine. On Monday, a blast on the bridge killed two people and damaged the road but the railway line, which runs parallel to it, was not damaged. The Kremlin blamed Kyiv for Monday's attack and said Ukraine had carried out a ""terrorist"" act.",Negative

Drones are showing us sharks like never before,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66252146,"– ""It's a full 180 degrees when you see the sharks in the wild,"" he said. ""They're just chillin'."" In recent years, amateurs, photographers, some scientists, and even law enforcement have embraced drones as a way to study and track sharks, giving us an unprecedented view of one of the world's most infamous but least understood predators. The technology has resulted in stunning aerial images—great white sharks tearing at a humpback whale carcass, or floating peacefully just feet away from surfers. But drones are also exposing our unease with sharing the waters, and have sparked a debate about how the devices can best be used to protect the safety of beachgoers as encounters with the creatures increase. Roughly a dozen species of sharks swim off the coast of New York's Long Island, including sand tiger sharks, dusky sharks, sandbar sharks, while juvenile great white sharks have also been spotted in these waters. Gov. Kathy Hochul is sending drones to municipality officials to spot sharks near shore and order swimmers out of the water if needed. But some experts said the technology is not particularly effective for monitoring sharks, as it only captures the fish during a limited part of their movements, when they swim close to the surface.",Positive

Hollywood strikes: 'Most of us have second jobs',https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-66255266,"– If you're eagerly waiting for the new Wicked film or next series of Stranger Things, you might be in for a long one. Some of the world's biggest films and TV shows have hit pause on production, as actors and writers in Hollywood strike over pay and worries about the impact AI could have on jobs. It's the biggest industry shutdown for over 60 years, meaning over 170,000 workers will refuse to perform any part of their job.

One of the largest exhibitions of its kind ever staged, this thrilling new collection at the Tate Modern features beautifully powerful photographs, videos, and installations that capture the essence of the realities of the fastest-growing continent in the world. British-Ghanaian curator Osei Bonsu has taken a thematic approach to explore the complex diversity of the vast continent through the eyes of 36 artists from Africa and its diaspora. The exhibition's title, A World in Common, is inspired by the work of the pioneering Cameroonian historian and intellectual Achille Mbembe, who argued that we must think of the world from an African perspective. Bonsu has divided the more than 150 works on show into three ""chapters"": identity and tradition, counter histories, and imagined futures, taking the viewer on a thrilling journey from Kinshasa's bustling streets to the deserts of Mauritania.",Positive
