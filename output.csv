Iannucci to put Kubrick's Dr Strangelove on stage,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-66186362,"– Stanley Kubrick's widow Christiane said: ""We have always been reluctant to let anyone adapt any of Stanley's work, and we never have. It was so important to him that it wasn't changed from how he finished it. But we could not resist authorising this project: the time is right; the people doing it are fantastic; and Strangelove should be brought to a new and younger audience. I am sure Stanley would have approved it too."" The film famously starred Peter Sellers in three main roles—the titular German scientist, a British officer who discovers a US general has unilaterally ordered a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union, and the American president who must attempt to avert all-out annihilation. Dr Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb—to use its full title—was released two years after the Cuban missile crisis brought the world to the brink of nuclear war. The show will be staged in London's West End next autumn, co-written and directed by double Olivier Award winner Sean Foley. The late director's family also granted access to Kubrick's archive, in which Iannucci said he had found papers relating to the film including ""some discarded scenes, first drafts [and] moments that they were going to shoot and then decided not to."" Iannucci added: ""Not just with the war in Ukraine, but also the whole sense of global warming and so on—it feels like a very relevant reassertion of the message that, this is the apocalyptic staring at us if we don't do anything about it.""",Negative
