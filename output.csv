Senior US commander says no contact with soldier The United Nations command says the man was on an organised tour when he crossed without permission.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66233797,"– North Korea is reported to have detained a serving US army soldier who crossed the heavily fortified border from South Korea without permission. The man was on an organized tour of the UN-run zone dividing the two countries. The Pentagon has identified the soldier as Private 2nd Class (PV2) Travis King. In a statement, a Pentagon spokesperson said that PV2 King had been in the army since January 2021. The United Nations Command, which operates the Demilitarised Zone and joint security area (JSA), said earlier its team had made contact with the North Korean military to try to negotiate his release. PV2 King passed through airport security in Seoul but somehow managed to leave the terminal and get on a tour of the border, from where he crossed over. It is unclear where or in what conditions PV2 King is being held. Greg Scarlatoiu, executive director of the Washington DC-based Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, told the BBC that North Korean authorities were likely to ""try pump information out of him"" about his military service and ""try to coerce him into becoming a propaganda tool."" Admiral John Aquilino Commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command said he was ""not tracking"" contact with North Korea.",Neutral
