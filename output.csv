Uproar over Italian judge's 10-second groping rule Young Italians object to the acquittal of a school caretaker who admitted groping a teenage student.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66174352,"– Does it count as sexual harassment if an assault lasts less than 10 seconds? Many young people in Italy are expressing outrage on social media, after a judge cleared a school caretaker of groping a teenager, because it did not last long enough. The case involves a 17-year-old student at a Rome high school. She described walking up a staircase to class with a friend, when she felt her trousers fall down, a hand touching her buttocks and grabbing her underwear. ""Love, you know I was joking,"" the man told her when she turned around. After the incident, which happened in April 2022, the student reported the caretaker, 66-year-old Antonio Avola, to police. A Rome public prosecutor asked for a three-and-a-half year prison sentence but this week the caretaker was acquitted of sexual assault charges. According to the judges, what happened ""does not constitute a crime"" because it lasted less than 10 seconds. The student fears the judges' ruling will deter girls and women from coming forward if they are subjected to such attacks. The case involves a 17-year-old student at a Rome high school.

Webb telescope image dazzles on first birthday,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66179323,"– It's exactly one year since the super observatory was handed over to astronomers to begin using in anger. And to celebrate, the US space agency Nasa has just released a spectacular image of one of the most photographed parts of the sky. It's the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex, which is the nearest star-forming region in space to us, being just 400 light-years away. Both professional and amateur stargazers like to look at Rho Ophiuchi, which can be found just to one side of the plane of the Milky Way. What Webb shows us is only a tiny part of this dense region of gas and dust, which is what you'd expect, given the telescope's astonishing resolution. The entire image is about half a light-year across, or 4.7tn km. ""There's so much going on in this spectacular picture, as young stars splash vibrant colors across the clouds of gas and dust from which they're being born,"" commented Prof Mark McCaughrean, Esa's senior advisor for science & exploration.",Positive

The industry is waiting to see whether the actors' union goes on strike this week, following in the footsteps of the Writers' Guild of America, which would effectively bring all major Hollywood events to a halt.",Positive

Syria aid lifeline facing closure after UN rift,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-66163612,"– Russia has threatened to end UN cross-border aid deliveries to millions of people in rebel-held north-west Syria, after the Security Council failed to pass two resolutions authorising them. Russia, an ally of Syria's government, vetoed a nine-month extension for the use of the Bab al-Hawa crossing that 13 of the 15 other council members backed. But it was then unable to muster enough votes for its proposal of six months. The US accused Russia of ""an act of utter cruelty."" Hundreds of lorries pass through Bab al-Hawa from Turkey every month with aid for 2.7 million civilians, who rely on it for food, shelter, and healthcare. The lifeline has become even more important since a devastating earthquake struck the region in February, killing more than 4,500 people and displacing 50,000 families. Although the Security Council decision means the UN must immediately stop aid deliveries through Bab al-Hawa, it will be able to continue until 13 August to use two additional border crossings that were opened with the consent of the Syrian government following the earthquake.",Negative
