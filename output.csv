"How desperate US prisoners try to escape deadly heat With no air con, a former prisoner describes lying in toilet water to survive brutal heat.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66274629,"– As temperatures rise, prisoners locked in cells without air conditioning—and the staff guarding them—are struggling. Calvin Johnson spent 37 years in a Texas state prison, including 37 summers in a jail cell with no air conditioning. On the countless blisteringly hot days, when temperatures climbed above 37.7C (100F), his survival depended upon a mix of creativity and desperation to stay cool—stay alive. ""Sometimes you can clog the commode and let the water run,"" Mr Johnson, 67, said. ""Put your pants and your shirt across that, and lay in the water for a while."" It's something he did ""a bunch of times."" Of the 100 prisons operated by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, 31 are fully air-conditioned and 55 have air-conditioning limited to certain areas. Since mid-June, at least nine prisoners have died of reported heart attacks or cardiac events in un-cooled Texas prisons where the outdoor heat indices were above 100 degrees, the Texas Tribune reported. The newspaper said at least another 14 died of unknown causes on days of extreme heat, and that they were often found unresponsive in their cells by prison staff. To describe what it's like in a prison when it reaches triple-digit temperatures, he said: ""It's like working in an inferno.""",Negative

Bear tracks were spotted close by and the authorities have laid traps to try to capture the grizzly. Adamson's mother Janet says she was an avid hiker and marathon runner who died doing what she loved best. ""God is so good. He took her by nature, not by any evil deed, bad accident or bad illness,"" Mrs Adamson told CBS's Kansas radio station KWCH-DT.
