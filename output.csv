What we know so far about Travis King's detention A soldier who crossed the border from South Korea was reportedly facing disciplinary action.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66240928,"– A US soldier is being held in North Korea after crossing the border from South Korea without authorization, the US military has confirmed. The crisis comes during a particularly tense time with the North, one of the world's most isolated states. Private 2nd Class (PV2) Travis King, 23, crossed from South Korea into the North after joining a Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) border tour. At the time he was being escorted back to the US to face disciplinary action, but he did not board the plane. Instead, he reportedly arrived at the boarding gate at Incheon Airport alone as military police officers were not allowed to accompany him all the way to the plane. Local reports quoting officials said he was released on 10 July after serving two months in jail on assault charges. PV2 King has been in the Army since January 2021. The incident came on the day that a US nuclear missile submarine arrived in the South Korean port of Busan—a visible demonstration of US military strength that angered the North Koreans.",Negative
"Russia strikes Ukraine grain after ending sea deal Attacks on Black Sea ports destroy 60,000 tonnes of grain and damage infrastructure, officials say.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66242446,"– Russia has pulled out of an international grain deal in place since last summer, guaranteeing safe passage for exports across the Black Sea. The Kremlin argued its demands for Russian exports had not been honored. Within hours of its withdrawal from the grain deal on Monday, Russia had struck the southern port cities of Odesa and Mykolaiv in the early hours of Tuesday. It followed that up with more strikes overnight into Wednesday, targeting grain terminals and port infrastructure in Odesa and further down the Black Sea coast in Chornomorsk, two of the three ports that were included in the export deal. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky said each missile strike was a blow not just to Ukraine, but to ""everyone in the world striving for a normal and safe life."" Germany Foreign Minister Anna Baerbock said that by covering Odesa with a hail bombs, Russian President Vladimir Putin was robbing the world of any hope Ukrainian grain and ""hitting the world's poorest."" Russia called its initial attack on Odesa a ""mass revenge strike"" for an attack on the Russian-built bridge over the Kerch strait linking occupied Crimea to Russia. Officials said the co-ordinated attack involved Kalibr missiles, Onyx supersonic and Kh-22 anti-ship missiles as well as kamikaze drones, fired from the Black Sea, Crimea and southern Russia. Ukraine's agriculture minister said a ""considerable amount"" of export infrastructure was out of operation.",Negative
Astonishing new finds in the ancient city of Pompeii New discoveries in the buried Roman city shed fresh light on life before Vesuvius erupted.,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66226417,"– A kitchen shrine adorned with serpents, a bakery, human skeletons, exquisite frescos, and yes, a picture of something that looks very much like pizza.) Dig anywhere in the ancient city destroyed by Mount Vesuvius in AD79 and you will unearth a treasure—a snapshot of a lost Roman world. It's extraordinary to think that one-third of the city buried under pumice and ash has yet to be excavated. BBC News has been given exclusive access to the investigation with Lion TV, which is making a three-part series to be aired early next year on the BBC. The latest work returns to a sector in the park last explored in the late 19th Century. Back then, archaeologists had opened up the frontage of houses on Via Di Nola, one of Pompeii's main thoroughfares, but hadn't delved far behind. Now, the diggers are progressively pulling away the volcanic ash and pea-sized stones, known as lapilli, that smothered Pompeii during the two catastrophic days of the Vesuvian eruption.",Negative
"Critics give their verdicts on the Barbie movie One review calls the film ""painfully funny"", but another describes it as ""uneven and disjointed"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-66242100,"– The much-publicised film is released this Friday—opposite Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer—and stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. But the Daily Mail called it ""uneven and disjointed"", while Time said it was ""very pretty but not very deep."" The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw also gave a lukewarm review, awarding the film three stars. He suggested Barbie is ""a good-natured but self-conscious movie"" that is ""occasionally very funny, but sometimes also somehow demure and inhibited, as if the urge to be funny can only be mean and satirical."" However, the Daily Mail's Sarah Vine was less keen on the representation of men. She wrote: ""It's a deeply anti-man movie, an extension of all that TikTok feminism that paints any form of masculinity—other than the most anodyne—as toxic and predatory... ""Every male character is either an idiot, a bigot or a sad, rather pathetic loser. If the roles were reversed, and a male director made a film about how all women were hysterical, neurotic, gold-digging witches, it would be denounced—quite rightly—as deeply offensive and sexist.""",Negative
"Disaffected Russians spying for UK, says MI6 head Many are silently appalled to see Russian forces pulverising Ukrainian cities, Sir Richard Moore says.",https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-66243806,"– MI6 has recruited a number of Russians disaffected by the Ukraine war, its chief has revealed, as he appealed for more to defect and work with them. In a speech in Prague, Sir Richard Moore said many Russians were ""silently appalled"" to see their armed forces ""pulverising"" Ukrainian cities. ""They are watching in horror as their soldiers ravage a kindred country."" He said the door was always open to any Russians who wanted to join the UK spy agency to work to end the bloodshed. ""We will handle their offers of help with the discretion and professionalism for which my service is famed,"" he added. Sir Richard admitted he was baffled by the events of 24 June when heavily-armed Wagner mercenaries advanced to within 200km of Moscow. He said the deal President Putin was forced to cut with the Wagner leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, was a humiliation. Asked how far Mr Putin, who has referred to nuclear weapons, was prepared to go, Sir Richard said: ""He really didn't fight back against Prigozhin, he cut a deal to save his skin, using the good offices of the leader of Belarus."" On the subject of AI, Sir Richard said it was being used to disrupt the supply of weapons to Russia but insisted machines would not replace human spies. Asked how far Mr Putin, who has referred to nuclear weapons, was prepared to go, Sir Richard said: ""He really didn't fight back against Prigozhin, he cut a deal to save his skin, using the good offices of the leader of Belarus.""",Positive
