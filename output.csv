Spain's conservatives fall short of all-out victory Popular Party leader Alberto Núñez Feijóo narrowly wins but is held back by left-wing parties.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66285245,"– The leader of Spain's opposition conservative party Alberto Nez Feijo has claimed victory in a snap election, but without the result he needed. Even with the support of the far right, his Popular Party (PP) has fallen short of a majority in parliament. The cheers at the rival Socialist camp were just as loud as Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Snchez declared: ""The reactionary bloc has failed."" While both can claim success, Spain is left with an inconclusive result. Party officials say Snchez is the first person Feijo will call to ask him to agree to support the PP in forming a ""solo government with specific agreements"" - a request the Socialist prime minister is unlikely to agree to. So what happens now? As the leader of the party that won the most votes, Mr Feijo will be invited by King Felipe VI to try to form a government. Vox leader Santiago Abascal was one of the few leaders not showing any sign of celebrating Sunday's result.",Positive
China school roof falls on volleyball team killing 11 Anguished parents have thronged a hospital seeking official updates on their children.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-66286576,"– Eleven people have died after the roof of a school gymnasium in north-east China collapsed while it was being used by a girls' volleyball team, state media reports. Many of the victims are children, eyewitnesses told local media, although this is yet to be officially confirmed. Police have detained the bosses at a local construction company, according to local media. They have been accused of dumping perlite, a form of volcanic glass, on the roof of the gym while working on an adjacent building project. The mineral had soaked up rain water following heavy downpours, which sent the roof into a collapse at 15:00 local time (07:00 GMT). The coach of the middle school's girls' volleyball team was heard calling out the students' names as rescue teams clawed through the rubble in Qiqihar city, China National Radio reported. Many users on social media in the country echoed concerns from the father in the video, questioning the treatment of worried parents by the police and officials at the scene.",Negative

BBC puts new deepfake detector to the test,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-66267961,"– ""We ask what is real about authentic videos? What is real about us? What is the watermark of being human?"" she says. In terms of finding the deepfakes, the system appeared to be pretty good. But when we got onto real, authentic videos it started to have a problem. Several times the system said a video was fake, when it was in fact real. The worry is that if the program says a video is fake, when it's genuine, it could cause real problems. The BBC used a dozen or so clips of former US President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden. Some were real, some were deepfakes created by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).",Negative
‘My character isn’t being a palatable black man’,https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/e25eda29-a509-4673-a6ed-96e63e3db28c,"– In an episode of BBC Three's new comedy drama Dreaming Whilst Black, Kwabena is told by the head of a film industry diversity scheme that she deliberately starts screenings late because she's ""used to running on black man time."" This comment was an example of a microaggression—a comment or action that subtly and often unintentionally expresses a prejudiced attitude toward a member of a marginalised group (such as a racial minority). It reflects the real-life experiences of the writers room of Dreaming Whilst Black—and the experience of many people in real workplaces. In an episode of BBC Three's new comedy drama Dreaming Whilst Black, Kwabena is told by the head of a film industry diversity scheme that she deliberately starts screenings late because she's 'used to running on black man time.'""",Positive

Virginia Woolf's personal copy of debut resurfaces,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-66273443,"– Virginia Woolf suffered from severe mental health breakdowns during the estimated seven year period it took to complete The Voyage Out. She fell back into depression and was put in a nursing home the day before it was published in 1915, staying there for six months. Her husband Leonard Woolf said she was ""writing every day with a kind of tortured intensity"" to finish the novel. The University of Sydney said it appeared the rediscovered copy of The Voyage Out had been lost ""through the bustle of everyday campus and library life."" Simon Cooper, Metadata Services Officer from the Fisher Library, found the book incorrectly shelved in 2021. He said: ""I knew the book didn't belong there, so I took it out and then saw the author's name handwritten on the first page. So, I looked up her handwriting to compare it, and it matched."" The University acquired the book in the late 1970s through Bow Windows in Lewes, East Sussex. Woolf and her husband Leonard Woolf had lived in the area - and members of the public can still visit their 16th-century country retreat, Monk's House, which is owned by the National Trust, which is owned by a private collector based in London.",Negative
Why is technology not making us more productive?,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66233654,"– We are often told that we are in the midst of a technological revolution. That business and the world of work continue to be transformed and improved by computers, the internet, the increased speed of communication, data processing, robotics, and now—artificial intelligence. If all this technology really is making us all work faster and better, there is precious little evidence. Between 1974 and 2008 the UK's productivity—the amount of output you get per worker— grew at an annual rate of 2.3%. But between 2008 and 2020 the rate of productivity growth collapsed to around 0.5% per annum. And in the first three months of this year, UK productivity was actually down 0.6% on a year earlier. Nick Crafts is emeritus professor of economic history at the University of Sussex Business School. He points out that the huge sea changes in economic performance we tend to think of as having happened almost overnight, actually took decades, and the same may well be happening how. Dame Diane Coyle is the Bennett professor of public policy at the University of Cambridge, and a recognized expert on how we measure productivity. ""There is nothing that doesn't use digital now, but it is difficult to see what is going on because none of this is visible in the statistics. We just don't collect the data in ways that would help us understand what is happening."" For example, a company that used to invest in its own computer servers and IT department might now outsource both to an overseas, cloud-based provider.",Positive
