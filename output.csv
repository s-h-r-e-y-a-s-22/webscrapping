"Polarised Spain eyes the hard-right ahead of vote Spain goes to the polls to decide its next government on Sunday, and a hard-right coalition is looking likely.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66268330,"– Spain's election on Sunday is provoking political tremors even before polls open. The most likely government to emerge—most analysts predict—will be a coalition including a hard-right nationalist party for the first time in Spain since the death of fascist dictator Francisco Franco in 1975. The political right, meanwhile, has said voters have a choice: Sanchez (the current center-left prime minister and his coalition including the far-left) or Spain. Implying that under another Sanchez government, the country will crumble. The rhetoric this election season has been toxic, with voters becoming increasingly polarised. It's a fight over values, traditions and about what being Spanish should mean in 2023.",Negative

"Senator releases FBI source's claim of Biden bribes The FBI deemed the informant ""highly credible"", but top Republicans concede the claim is unverified.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66272217,"– A top Senate Republican has released an FBI document detailing an allegation President Joe Biden and his son accepted bribes from a Ukrainian firm. Chuck Grassley, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said: ""The American people can now read this document for themselves."" The unclassified memo is a June 2020 internal FBI report outlining claims by a foreign informant. Senior congressional Republicans have acknowledged the allegation is unverified. The memo contains a claim that Hunter Biden was hired by the Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, in 2013 as a way to gain support from his father, who was the US vice-president at the time. It also alleges that Burisma made two $5m (£3.9m) payments to ""the Bidens"" as part of its efforts to remove Ukraine's prosecutor general at the time, Viktor Shokin - and that there were audio recordings of both Hunter and Joe Biden that supported this. The FBI officials have described FD-1023 forms as a means to document ""raw, unverified"" intelligence information that does not reflect the conclusions of investigators.",Positive
"In Aspen, nervousness over Ukraine's critical moment At the Aspen Security Forum, the war in Ukraine is upper-most in the minds of policymakers.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66273787,"– The rarefied setting of Aspen, Colorado, with its mountain views and manicured lawns, is a world away from the minefields and trenches of Ukraine's front-line, but for a few days this past week the two places were connected. Ukraine is a month into its counter-offensive and it is clear that it's proving, as one speaker put it, a ""hard slog"" with often just a few meters of ground taken each day. The war may look slow but it is not a stalemate - or at least not yet. Ukraine relies on US military aid - and you can glimpse tension over what has been given and when. Where President Zelensky in Aspen renewed his call for more, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan barely an hour or two later said that US military advisers do not believe F-16 fighter jets would play a significant role in current operations. The looming shadow of Donald Trump also hung over Aspen with questions about what his possible re-election would mean not just for Ukraine but for America's position in the world and relationship with its allies.",Neutral

Drones are showing us sharks like never before,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66252146,"– ""It's a full 180 degrees when you see the sharks in the wild,"" he said. ""They're just chillin'."" In recent years, amateurs, photographers, some scientists, and even law enforcement have embraced drones as a way to study and track sharks, giving us an unprecedented view of one of the world's most infamous but least understood predators. The technology has resulted in stunning aerial images—great white sharks tearing at a humpback whale carcass, or floating peacefully just feet away from surfers. But drones are also exposing our unease with sharing the waters, and have sparked a debate about how the devices can best be used to protect the safety of beachgoers as encounters with the creatures increase. Roughly a dozen species of sharks swim off the coast of New York's Long Island, including sand tiger sharks, dusky sharks, sandbar sharks, while juvenile great white sharks have also been spotted in these waters. Gov. Kathy Hochul is sending drones to municipality officials to spot sharks near shore and order swimmers out of the water if needed. But some experts said the technology is not particularly effective for monitoring sharks, as it only captures the fish during a limited part of their movements, when they swim close to the surface.",Positive
