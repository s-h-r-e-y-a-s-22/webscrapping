Why is US giving Ukraine 'abhorrent' cluster bombs? This hideous weapon is banned by more than 100 countries - so the move will likely draw intense criticism.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66133527,"– The US has announced it is complying with a Ukrainian request to supply it with controversial cluster munitions. The move is likely to draw intense criticism from human rights groups as the weapon is banned by more than 100 countries. cluster munitions are a method of dispersing large numbers of tiny bomblets from a rocket, missile, or artillery shell that scatters them in mid-flight over a wide area. They are intended to explode on impact but a significant proportion are ""duds"", meaning they don't explode initially—this happens especially if they land on wet or soft ground. They can then explode at a later date on being picked up or trodden on, killing or maiming the victim. Ukraine's forces are running desperately low on artillery shells, largely because, like the Russians, they use them up at an extraordinarily high rate and Ukraine's Western allies cannot replace them at the rate they are needed. cluster munitions are a hideous, indiscriminate weapon that is banned in much of the world for good reason. This US move will inevitably place it somewhat at odds with its Western allies and any perceived split in that alliance is exactly what President Vladimir Putin wants and needs.",Negative
"Twitter threatens legal action over Threads app Its owner Elon Musk says ""competition is fine, cheating is not"" a day after the rival app launched.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66129215,"– Twitter is considering legal action against Meta over its fast-growing rival app Threads. Threads, which was launched to millions on Wednesday, is similar to Twitter and has been pitched by Meta bosses as a ""friendly"" alternative. Twitter's Elon Musk said ""competition is fine, cheating is not"" - but Meta denied claims in a legal letter that ex-Twitter staff helped create Threads. More than 70 million people have signed up for the new app, according to Meta. Twitter has an estimated 350 million users, according to Statista. Specifically, Mr Spiro alleged that Meta had hired dozens of former Twitter employees who ""had and continue to have access to Twitter's trade secrets and other highly confidential information"" that ultimately helped Meta develop what he termed the ""copycat"" Threads app. Twitter's Elon Musk said ""competition is fine, cheating is not"" in response to a post on Twitter that referred to the legal letter.",Positive
El Paso Walmart gunman gets 90 life sentences The attacker may still face the death penalty if convicted for murder charges in state court.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66111468,"– The Texas gunman who killed 23 people at a Walmart in 2019 has been sentenced to 90 consecutive life sentences in federal prison. Patrick Crusius, 24, had pleaded guilty after federal prosecutors said they would not seek the death penalty. The sentencing follows two days of emotional testimony from witnesses, as Crusius sat face-to-face with survivors and relatives. It was one of the deadliest mass shootings in US history. As police escorted Crusius out of the courtroom, Dean Reckard, whose mother, Margie Reckard, was killed in the shooting, exclaimed, ""we will be seeing you again, you coward. We will see you again"", the El Paso Times reported.",Negative
Neutral Swiss join Europe's Sky Shield defence Switzerland and Austria are the latest of 19 countries to join the plan to protect Europe's skies.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66130857,"– Switzerland and Austria have signed a declaration of intent to join the European air defense system Sky Shield. The system was initiated by Germany following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and is designed to allow European countries to buy defense systems together, and train together. It's being viewed as a historic moment for neutral Switzerland. But some right-wing Swiss politicians fear Sky Shield is a compromise too far. If an attack heading for one of its Sky Shield neighbors flew over Switzerland, for example, would the Swiss shoot it down, even if it wasn't involved in the conflict? In signing an agreement to join the initiative, Switzerland and Austria have stressed their neutrality remains unchanged, but that hypothetical question hasn't really been answered. But the debate over sanctions, and now over Sky Shield, is just part of a wider Swiss soul-searching over neutrality.",Negative

The maps revealing urban heat stress,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230706-the-simple-ways-cities-can-adapt-to-heatwaves,"– There have been at least 13 heat-related deaths in Texas over the past two weeks, as meteorologists predict the extreme heatwave will spread over the southern US, and that temperatures exceeding 43C (110F) will be commonplace. Images that are constantly being captured by the International Space Station not only show extreme land surface temperatures in cities, but also dramatically cooler areas that are the result of having parks or water features in densely populated areas. One study found that neighborhoods within a 10-minute walk of a park are as much as 3C cooler than areas outside that range. Mapping these extreme hotspots are a vital asset to city planners as the world warms up and heat-related deaths continue to rise.",Positive

Why America could be overtaken as the corn superpower,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66089408,"– It's not just China backing away from US corn: Reuters recently reported that exports to all destinations excluding China were at their second-lowest in two decades. American farmers' hard work and technological expertise has cemented its place at the top of the pile when it comes to corn exports. But its corn superpower status may be coming to an end. In fact, after decades at the top, it is on the verge of being overtaken as the world's biggest exporter of the crop. Buyers in China - the world's biggest importer of corn - have been canceling orders from the US, in large part because there are cheaper alternatives elsewhere. It is a troubling trend for US farmers.

Can Threads make more money than Elon Musk’s Twitter?,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66127141,"– Mark Zuckerberg launched his alternative to Twitter, Threads, it had already claimed some 30 million sign-ups - lending it credibility as a serious contender in the world of social media. But analysts think it's a sign that Mr Zuckerberg's Meta has a good shot at wooing some of its gigantic 3 billion-plus users on Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp to the new offering - and bringing advertisers with them. After all, Mr Zuckerberg, whose Meta made more than $117bn in sales last year, has a monster track record when it comes to selling ads - and none of the apparent qualms of Mr Musk, who has disdained advertising at his electric car company, Tesla, and been looking for alternative ways to fund Twitter.Mr Zuckerberg said there would be no ads on Threads initially, giving the company time to fine-tune the app, which allows users to scroll endlessly through text-based posts.But eventually, Threads adverts could add 1% to 5% to Meta's overall revenue, generating more than $6bn in the most optimistic scenario, Justin Patterson, equity research analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets wrote in a note.Under Mr Musk, Twitter, which had struggled to be profitable, has alienated advertisers with abrupt changes to how the site moderates content and more recently, a new limit on how many posts audiences can see.Mr Musk was ready on Thursday with the counter-punch, reportedly threatening legal action against Meta for stealing trade secrets.",Positive
