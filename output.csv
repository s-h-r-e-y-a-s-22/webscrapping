US approves first over-the-counter birth control The government said the move would help reduce women's barriers to accessing contraception.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66191585,"– The US government has approved the first-ever over-the-counter birth control pill. The Food and Drug Administration announced on Thursday birth control pill Opill will be available without a prescription for women of all ages. In a statement, the agency said the move would help reduce women's barriers to accessing contraception. The manufacturer of Opill has said it will most likely be available over the counter in early 2024. Doctors say that the progestin-only pill—often known as the ""minipill""—is a particularly safe form of contraception because it does not contain oestrogen, meaning it has fewer side effects and health risks. The most common side effects of Opill include irregular bleeding, headaches, dizziness and nausea. The contraception is also not recommended for women who have had breast cancer. The US joins more than 100 countries around the world that have made the birth control pill available over the counter, including most countries in Latin America, as well as India, China and the United Kingdom.",Positive
"Hollywood actors set to strike alongside writers The SAG-AFTRA union is expected to opt for strike action on Thursday, after studio talks broke down.",https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-66185585,"– Tens of thousands of Hollywood actors are preparing to strike after last-ditch talks between their union and streaming giants broke down around a major deadline. The Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) has agreed to one extension of talks with major studios. But the union has been unable to agree a deal over issues around pay residuals and the use of artificial intelligence. From Thursday, its members are expected to join screenwriters on picket lines. Now, the negotiating committee of SAG-AFTRA - the union which represents 160,000 actors and performers - has voted unanimously to recommend strike action to its board. It had been seeking a fairer split of streaming profits and a guarantee that AI will not be used to replace duties performed by actors. ""We are not confident that the employers have any intention of bargaining toward an agreement,"" the committee said after Wednesday's midnight deadline passed. ""Time is running out,"" it warned. The guild's president, Fran Drescher, accused streaming companies of refusing ""to meaningfully engage on some topics and on others completely stonewalled us."" The group representing the studios, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) said it was ""disappointed"" by the collapse of negotiations. A strike could rule them out of the film's big US premiere in New York on Monday and beyond, while other major film and TV events like next week's annual Comic-Con event in San Diego could also be scaled down.",Positive
The problem statue in America's most sacred shrine A Confederate memorial in Arlington National Cemetery is coming down. But what happens next?,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66004176,"– When Judith Ezekiel was five years old, her grandfather drove her and her two brothers to Arlington National Cemetery, to see a statue made by their relative. Moses Jacob Ezekiel, Judith's cousin four times removed, was a renowned Jewish sculptor in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries. His most famous work, what he called the ""crowning achievement"" of his career, has stood inside Arlington since 1914: the Confederate Memorial. The monument, a bronze statue and plinth on top of a granite base, commemorates the men who fought and died for the slave-holding southern states in the US Civil War. But by next year, by order of the US government, the monument must be removed. The decision is part of an ongoing movement to rethink how the US remembers the Confederacy. Some 377 memorials have been renamed or removed since 2015. But as of 2022, some 723 remain, according to a report by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Ms Ezekiel, a historian and professor emerita of women's and African American studies, thought little more of the statue until decades after her visit, in 2017.",Negative
