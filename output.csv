Israel passes reform law despite mass protests A bill which has caused uproar becomes law as protesters face water cannon outside parliament.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-66258416,"– Israeli MPs have passed into law a highly controversial bill despite mass protests which aimed to thwart it. The law removes the power of the Supreme Court to overrule government actions it considers unreasonable. The planned reforms have triggered some of the biggest protests in Israel's history, with opponents warning they imperil Israel as a democracy. The controversial reforms have polarised Israel, triggering one of the most serious domestic crises in the country's history. Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets weekly since the start of the year in protest at what they say is an attack on democracy. The law removes the power of the Supreme Court to overrule government actions it considers unreasonable. The vote brings to a head months of turmoil, with Israel's president warning political leaders on Monday that the country was ""in a state of national emergency.""",Negative
Justice department sues Texas over border barrier Texas officials argue the barrier will help deter migrants from crossing into the US from Mexico.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66296989,"– The Biden administration has sued Texas over a floating barrier installed by the state in the Rio Grande river to deter migrants on the US-Mexico border. The barrier, made partly of orange buoys attached by webbings, was announced by state's Republican governor Greg Abbott in early June. Federal authorities say the barriers in the river flout federal law and present ""humanitarian concerns."" Ahead of the lawsuit, Mr Abbott vowed to ""see"" the government in court. On Monday, Mr Abbott struck a defiant tone and blamed President Joe Biden for a ""record-breaking level of illegal immigration"" that made the barrier necessary. On Tuesday, a White House spokesman said the buoys are ""making it hard for the men and women of Border Patrol to do their jobs of securing the border, and putting migrants and border agents in danger.""",Negative
"Burns from asphalt and metal rise in US heatwave Superheated asphalt or metal seatbelts can melt flesh in minutes, officials warn amid intense heat.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66275785,"– A prolonged heatwave in the US has led to an uptick in severely burned patients who were injured after touching hot surfaces or objects. Medics in Arizona said some patients were hurt after falling onto asphalt which had been heated by the sun. The city of Phoenix has now seen a record-breaking 24 consecutive days of temperatures above 110F (43C). Officials warn that ground temperatures can reach near-boiling, and warn people to seek shelter from the fiery heat. Dr Kevin Foster of the Arizona Burn Center tells BBC News that all of the center's 45 hospital beds are currently occupied, and around one-third of those patients have suffered severe contact burns from scorching concrete and asphalt surfaces. Christopher Malcolm, a 73-year-old US Air Force veteran in Las Vegas, told NBC News that he was badly burned after sitting on the ground at a bus stop on a day with temperatures reaching 110F.",Negative
"Officials investigate police dog attack on driver A video shows the K-9 pulling down the driver, who is black, as he was trying to surrender in Ohio.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66296988,"– Police in Circleville, Ohio, are investigating an incident in which a police officer released a dog on a black truck driver who was trying to surrender. The incident, which took place in the town of Circleville on July, began after police tried to pull over a lorry that had failed to stop for inspection. After a chase, the driver, Jadarrius Rose, emerged with his hands up, but was bitten by the police dog. Rose, 23, told dispatchers he feared for his life during the chase. Bodycam and dashcam footage of the incident shows a lengthy chase that ended with the lorry surrounded by police officers and vehicles. Once the vehicle was stopped, one police officer can be heard telling Mr Rose to ""get on the ground or you're going to get bit."" But another officer, believed to be an Ohio state trooper, can be heard repeatedly relaying instructions to ""not release the dog with his hands up."" Rose complied with instructions from officers and had his hands up in the air. But the police dog—a German Shepherd—was released and seen pulling Mr Rose to the ground in a grassy area near the road. The president of the nearby Columbus chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP), Nana Watson, was quoted by CBS, the BBC's US partner, as saying that the officer's actions were ""barbaric.""",Negative

Afghan women mourn the end of beauty salons,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66271855,"– Beauty salons across Afghanistan will close in the coming weeks on the Taliban's orders. Their closure will lead to the loss of an estimated 60,000 jobs. Salons had been allowed to keep operating since the Taliban retook power two years ago, but it reversed its position last month. The decision further restricts spaces open to Afghan women, who are already barred from classrooms, gyms and parks. 23-year-old Zarmina was in a beauty salon getting her hair dyed dark brown when news of the approaching closures came through. ""The owner got a big shock and started to cry. She is the breadwinner for her family,"" the mother of two said. ""Now women only talk about unemployment, discrimination and poverty,"" Zarmina says.",Negative
How desperate US prisoners try to escape deadly heat,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66274629,"– As temperatures rise, prisoners locked in cells without air conditioning—and the staff guarding them—are struggling. Calvin Johnson spent 37 years in a Texas state prison, including 37 summers in a jail cell with no air conditioning. On the countless blisteringly hot days, when temperatures climbed above 37.7C (100F), his survival depended upon a mix of creativity and desperation to stay cool—stay alive. The increasing frequency of dangerously hot conditions has drawn renewed attention to US prisons and calls for reform. Thirteen states in the hottest parts of the US—including Texas and Arizona—lack universal air conditioning in prisons, according to an analysis by the Prison Policy Initiative, creating deadly conditions. Johnson said he even saw some inmates drinking water from the toilet because it was a few degrees cooler than what came from the cell's sink. Of the 100 prisons operated by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, 31 are fully air-conditioned and 55 have air-conditioning limited to certain areas. Since mid-June, at least nine prisoners have died of reported heart attacks or cardiac events in un-cooled Texas prisons where the outdoor heat indices were above 100 degrees, the Texas Tribune reported. TDCJ spokesperson Amanda Hernandez said it was inaccurate to label any death as heat-related before an investigation is complete. To describe what it's like in a prison where triple-digit temperatures fill the air, he said: ""It's like working in an inferno.""",Negative
How a Hindu holy book influenced Oppenheimer,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-66288900,"– In July 1945, two days before the explosion of the first atomic bomb in the New Mexico desert, Robert Oppenheimer recited a stanza from the Bhagavad Gita, or The Lord's Song. Oppenheimer, a theoretical physicist, had been introduced to Sanskrit, the ancient Indian language, and subsequently the Gita, as a teacher in Berkeley years before. Some right wing Hindus have complained—particularly about the sex scene with lover Jean Tatlock, played by Florence Pugh—saying the film is an attack on their religion and demanding cuts. But India's film censors found no problem with it and at the box office it's the Hollywood hit of the year in India, faring better than Barbie since the two blockbusters opened on Friday.",Negative
