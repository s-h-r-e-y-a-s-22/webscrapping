"Kerch bridge is hated symbol of Russian occupation With Ukraine aiming to deal a decisive blow to Russian forces, the bridge is a key target.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66221252,"– The Kerch bridge is one of the most important. If the bridge is out of action, even for a short time, this will complicate Russia's logistical challenges, a key aspect of the early phase of Ukraine's counter-offensive. Last October's devastating explosion on the bridge—which Russia blamed on a massive truck bomb, organized by Ukrainian intelligence—came as Ukraine was pressuring Russian forces to abandon the city of Kherson. Now Kyiv wants to make life as difficult as possible for Russian forces occupying areas south of the Dnipro River. If, as seems likely, Kyiv was behind this latest attack on the Kerch bridge, it should be seen in the context of Ukraine's wider effort to liberate areas of the south occupied during last year's full-scale Russian invasion.",Negative
Tunnel horror brings home climate fears to South Korea The country is less used to dealing with the severe effects of a warming planet.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66219597,"– South Korea's president has said he will ""completely overhaul"" the country's approach to extreme weather, as ""these events will become more commonplace.""It's been more than 48 hours since extreme rainfall caused a riverbank to break, and water suddenly and forcefully filled the major underpass, stopping vehicles dead.

The Capitol rioters who regret saying sorry Taking back their remorse could land defendants with stiffer sentences.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66169914,"– A growing number of Capitol rioters have gone back on their guilty pleas and apologies—including one of the most recognizable faces from 6 January.

His about-face is such that he is even taking his case back to court to ask his guilty plea to be reversed. Since 6 January 2021, over 1,000 people have been charged over their participation in the riots, and almost half have pleaded guilty. But chatter on online forums and media coverage shows a small but growing number have started to have a change of heart.",Negative

Why Hollywood actors have walked off set,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66208226,"– The last time both writers and actors manned the picket line, the strike lasted 10 weeks and was led by then-actor Ronald Reagan. But at the press conference announcing the strike, SAG's chief negotiator, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, explained why the union flatly rejected the idea. ""They proposed that our background performers should be able to be scanned, get one day's pay, and their company should own that scan, their image, their likeness and should be able to use it for the rest of eternity, in any project they want with no consent and with no compensation."" SAG-AFTRA says members are striking for more equitable division of the profits from movies and television. But studio executives have said their demands are unreasonable, leaving Tinseltown at an impasse. Here's why Hollywood is on strike.",Negative

Can US and China set aside rivalry for climate action?,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-66185535,"– John Kerry's office says he wants to engage with China on ""increasing implementation and ambition"" and ensuring a successful COP28, the UN climate change conference scheduled for the end of the year. But they are also the world's two largest carbon emitters, making them the ""G2 of energy consumption, energy use and pollution,"" noted Dan Kammen, energy professor at the University of California, Berkeley. The two countries are the biggest investors in renewable energy, with China alone making up more than half of the world's total renewable energy investment, according to one assessment. But they are also the world's two largest carbon emitters, making them the ""G2 of energy consumption, energy use and pollution,"" noted Dan Kammen, energy professor at the University of California, Berkeley. China has now shifted to prioritising its energy security. Last year, China approved a dramatic increase in its coal power output, the equivalent of approving two large coal power plants a week, according to one analysis. Analysts say Mr Kerry may try to persuade China to fully capitalize on its clean energy resources and achieve carbon neutrality more quickly. China aims to peak its carbon emissions by 2030 and become carbon neutral by 2060— goals which some say are too far off and give it too much leeway. Earlier this month Ms Yellen urged Beijing to donate to international climate funds set up by richer countries to help poorer economies struggling with climate change.",Positive
The burnt out villages at frontlines of India violence,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-66161535,"– The Meitei-dominated villages—where nearly 3,000 people lived—were particularly vulnerable, nestled against the foothills in close proximity to Kuki settlements. Villages of the two groups are barely separated, with only 1,500 feet between them. The underlying tensions in Manipur stem from a complex interplay of various factors, one of which is a crackdown on drugs in recent years. On 3 May, ethnic violence sparked by a thorny affirmative action row erupted in India's north-eastern state of Manipur. More than 130 people have died since, during clashes between the majority Meitei and the tribal Kuki minority groups. The ongoing violence has tragically led to a near-complete segregation of the two groups.",Negative
