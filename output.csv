"Can US and China set aside rivalry for climate action? The two biggest economies and polluters need to work together to avert the crisis, experts say.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-66185535,"– John Kerry's office says he wants to engage with China on ""increasing implementation and ambition"" and ensuring a successful COP28, the UN climate change conference scheduled for the end of the year. But they are also the world's two largest carbon emitters, making them the ""G2 of energy consumption, energy use and pollution,"" noted Dan Kammen, energy professor at the University of California, Berkeley. The two countries are the biggest investors in renewable energy, with China alone making up more than half of the world's total renewable energy investment, according to one assessment. But they are also the world's two largest carbon emitters, making them the ""G2 of energy consumption, energy use and pollution,"" noted Dan Kammen, energy professor at the University of California, Berkeley. China has now shifted to prioritising its energy security. Last year, China approved a dramatic increase in its coal power output, the equivalent of approving two large coal power plants a week, according to one analysis. Analysts say Mr Kerry may try to persuade China to fully capitalize on its clean energy resources and achieve carbon neutrality more quickly. China aims to peak its carbon emissions by 2030 and become carbon neutral by 2060— goals which some say are too far off and give it too much leeway. Earlier this month Ms Yellen urged Beijing to donate to international climate funds set up by richer countries to help poorer economies struggling with climate change.",Positive
