New drugs for Alzheimer’s hailed as turning point The antibody treatment donanemab helps clear the brain of a damaging protein that builds up in Alzheimer's.,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-66221116,"– The Alzheimer's Society said: ""This is truly a turning point in the fight against Alzheimer's and science is proving that it is possible to slow down the disease."" Donanemab, made by Eli Lilly, works in the same way as lecanemab—developed by companies Eisai and Biogen—which created headlines around the world when it was proven to slow the disease. The drug's effects may be modest, but the results provide further confirmation that removing amyloid from the brain may change the course of Alzheimer's, and help people affected by this devastating disease if they're treated at the right time, they say. The Alzheimer's Society said: ""Timely, accurate diagnosis is key, and currently only 2% of people in England and Wales receive their diagnosis through the specialist investigations needed to be eligible for these treatments."" Donanemab costs around $27,500 (£21,000) in the US, where it is licensed. It is not clear how much Donanemab may cost and how long it might take to get approval in the UK, but Alzheimer's experts said: ""Today's announcement marks another milestone. Thanks to decades of research, the outlook for dementia and its impact on people and society is finally changing, and we're entering a new era where Alzheimer's disease could become treatable.""",Positive
