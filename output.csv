A Wagner fighter reveals his part in the mutiny A junior commander says lower-ranking mercenaries had no idea what was happening during the rebellion.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66247915,"– A mercenary who took part in the attempted mutiny against Russian President Vladimir Putin says he and his fellow fighters ""didn't have a clue"" what was going on. In the space of just 24 hours, the leader of the Wagner Group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, staged an insurrection, sending troops into the southern city of Rostov, then further on towards Moscow. Wagner fighters rarely talk to the media, but BBC Russian spoke to a junior commander who found himself in the middle of the action. Gleb—not his real name—had previously been involved in the fighting for the symbolic town of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine. Early in the morning on 23 June they got the call to join a column of Wagner fighters leaving Ukraine. The order came from a Wagner commander who Gleb is reluctant to name for security reasons, but who was acting on orders from Prigozhin and the Wagner Command Council. Gleb says no one was told where the column was heading, but he was surprised when he realized they were moving away from the frontline. The Wagner fighters encountered absolutely no resistance, he says, as they crossed the Russian border into the Rostov region. Gleb confirms media reports that this column was led by Wagner founder Dmitry Utkin, a former special forces officer who is rarely seen in public. Gleb was contacted by one of his superiors and told, without any explanation, that he and his unit should now return to base in Luhansk.",Positive
