"Stranger than fiction: When Putin met the mutineer The latest twist in Russia's mutiny saga surpasses Dostoyevsky for mystery, Steve Rosenberg says.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66154912,"– On the morning of 24 June, the day of the mutiny, Vladimir Putin accused the Wagner leadership of ""treachery"" and ""a stab in the back."" Then, with the mercenaries just 120 miles from the Russian capital, the Kremlin and Wagner did a deal. The mutiny was over. Not only was Yevgeny Prigozhin not clapped in irons and hauled off to the police station for his rebellion. It's now emerged that five days later he was in the Kremlin, together with his commanders, sitting round the table and chatting with President Putin. According to the agreement, Mr Prigozhin was supposed to leave Russia for Belarus, along with those Wagner fighters who expressed the desire to join him. But last week the leader of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, told us that the Wagner chief and his mercenaries weren't there.

Transparent mouse could improve cancer drug tests,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66119980,"– A new scanning method involving a see-through mouse could improve how cancer drugs are tested, by picking up tumors previously too small to detect. Prof Ali Ertrk of the Helmholtz Munich research center worked out how to make a dead mouse transparent in 2018. His team have now used chemicals to highlight specific tissues so that they can be scanned in unprecedented detail. Dr Rupal Mistry, research information manager at Cancer Research UK, said: ""This exciting and unique scanning technique has a wealth of potential for building our knowledge of how our bodies work and what goes wrong in diseases like cancer. While researchers will only be able to use the technique to examine the bodies of deceased mice, it could tell us a lot about how cancer develops at the early stages of the disease. Dr Nana-Jane Chipampe, of the Sanger Institute in Cambridge, is excited at the prospect of using the new scanning technique to study how cells develop in the human body. Prof Ertrk's scanning method can only be used on dead mice, to give a picture of how much cancer has progressed, or potentially, whether a treatment has worked.",Negative
Bickering Nato aims for Ukraine unity as Putin watches on,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66135326,"– NATO is just hours away from its high-profile annual summit—a stress test for the alliance, with Russian President Vladimir Putin watching intently from the sidelines. With Joe Biden, Emmanuel Macron, Rishi Sunak, Olaf Scholz and so many more world leaders attending, ambassadors of the alliance's 31 member states have been huddled together, arguing about what they can, should or will announce publicly on Ukraine. The conundrum: How do you send Moscow a clear message that the West won't stand by and allow the Kremlin to grab sovereign territory in Ukraine or anywhere else in Europe, while at the same time avoiding coming into direct conflict with nuclear power Russia and risking all-out war? According to US President Joe Biden: ""I don't think there is unanimity in Nato about whether or not to bring Ukraine into the Nato family now, at this moment, in the middle of a war."" And 500 days into Russia's invasion, NATO's balancing act isn't getting any easier. Ukraine is clear. It wants an equal seat at the NATO table—with all the security guarantees that go with that—and it wants it now. Or, because it recognizes NATO can't admit a new member while that state is at war, it wants at least ""a clear signal that Ukraine will be in the alliance... not that the door is open for us, which is not enough, but that Ukraine will be in it.""",Negative
