Turkey backs Sweden's Nato membership The Nato chief says President Erdogan will drop opposition to Sweden becoming the alliance's 32nd member.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66160319,"– Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has agreed to support Sweden's bid to join NATO, the military alliance's chief Jens Stoltenberg says. He said the Turkish leader would forward Sweden's bid to parliament in Ankara and ""ensure ratification."" Turkey had previously spent months blocking Sweden's application, accusing it of hosting Kurdish militants. As one of NATO's 31 members, Turkey has a veto over any new country joining the group. Stoltenberg said Turkey and Sweden had addressed ""Turkey's legitimate security concerns"" and as a result Sweden had amended its constitution, changed its laws, expanded its counter-terrorism operation against the PKK (Kurdistan Workers' Party) and resumed arms exports to Turkey. Ukraine cannot join the bloc during the war—but he wants the summit to give a ""clear signal"" on Ukraine's bid.",Positive
Palestinian boy shot in Jenin was unarmed - family It comes after videos emerge of the moment the 16-year-old was killed during an Israeli assault.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-66153159,"– Israel said all the Palestinians who were killed were combatants. But the videos show Abdul Rahman Hassan Ahmad Hardan, 16, was unarmed when he was shot. The teenager was shot in the head outside al-Amal hospital on the second day of the military incursion, which Israel said was intended to root out a ""safe haven of terrorism"" in Jenin refugee camp. Israel Defense Forces spokesman Lt Col Richard Hecht, asked by the BBC last week about the casualties, said: ""There were 12 people killed, every one that was killed was involved directly with terrorism."" After his death, Abdul Rahman Hardan was claimed as a member by the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad. But his family has distanced itself from the claim, and Israel has yet to show evidence he posed a threat at the time he was fatally shot. Under international law, the use of firearms by security forces against civilians is defined as a measure of last resort, and can only take place to stop an ""imminent threat of death or serious injury.""",Negative
