Soldier in North Korea is absent without leave - Pentagon The White House says Pyongyang has failed to respond to attempts to negotiate release.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66253401,"– The Pentagon says it considers army private Travis King to be ""absent without leave"" in North Korea after he crossed the border during a tour. Officials also admitted they had no idea of his condition or where he was being held. PV2 King dashed across the heavily fortified border area on Tuesday. The Washington-based news website the Messenger said it had seen an internal US government report which described PV2 King's actions when he crossed the border. PV2 King had been due to fly back to the US from South Korea, where he was based, to face disciplinary action. But the 23-year-old did not board the plane when he parted ways with his military escorts at Incheon Airport near Seoul on Tuesday and instead embarked on an apparently pre-booked tour to the border—the details of how he managed to do that are still unclear. Experts say such a low-ranking soldier would have little propaganda and intelligence value, which may prompt North Korea into releasing him—but what will happen to him remains highly uncertain.",Negative

Drones are showing us sharks like never before Astonishing aerial footage reveals sharks are closer to us than we think – and usually leave us alone.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66252146,"– ""It's a full 180 degrees when you see the sharks in the wild,"" he said. But some experts said the technology is not particularly effective for monitoring sharks, as it only captures the fish during a limited part of their movements, when they swim close to the surface. But drones are also exposing our unease with sharing the waters, and have sparked a debate about how the devices can best be used to protect the safety of beachgoers as encounters with the creatures increase. Roughly a dozen species of sharks swim off the coast of New York's Long Island, including sand tiger sharks, dusky sharks, sandbar sharks, while juvenile great white sharks have also been spotted in these waters. Gov. Kathy Hochul is sending drones to municipality officials to spot sharks near shore and order swimmers out of the water if needed. But some experts said the technology is not particularly effective for monitoring sharks, as it only captures the fish during a limited part of their movements, when they swim close to the surface.",Positive
Will Canada finally win a World Cup? The country's women's football team has never been this strong. But can it win the ultimate trophy?,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66251335,"– Before the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, the Canadian women's football coach Bev Priestman gave her team a three-word motto: change the color. For two Olympics in a row, in London and Rio, the team had medalled, claiming a respectable bronze both times. But the third-place results helped cement Canada's position internationally as a sometimes forgettable squad, despite the team's consistent strength, growing national popularity, and its star captain, Christine Sinclair—the all-time leading goal scorer in international football, across both male and female leagues. And then two years ago, at the Tokyo games, the Canadians did it. By the time they reached Tokyo, the squad was led by new head coach Ms Priestman, 37, who steered the team to their Olympic gold and—maybe just as importantly—their first victory over their US rivals in 20 years. Canada has also lost some of its strongest players to injuries, including forward Janine Beckie and midfielder Desiree Scott. But the squad's goal-scoring has often fallen short.",Positive

"World will miss 1.5C warming limit, climate expert warns",https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66256101,"– A leading British climate scientist has told the BBC he believes the target to limit global warming to 1.5C will be missed. Professor Sir Bob Watson, former head of the UN climate body, told the BBC's Today program he was ""pessimistic."" His warning comes amidst a summer of extreme heat for Europe, China, and the US. The world agreed to try to limit the temperature increase due to climate change to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels at a UN conference in Paris in 2015. That target has become the centerpiece of global efforts to tackle climate change. Climate scientists have been warning governments for years that they are not cutting their countries' emissions quickly enough to keep within this target. But it is surprising for someone as senior and well respected as the former head of the UN climate science body the IPCC to be so frank that he believes it will be missed.",Positive
