Top US senator calls for Prime Energy drink probe Chuck Schumer alleges the drink is being targeted at children despite its high caffeine content.,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66150857,"– Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has called on regulators to investigate an energy drink promoted by high-profile YouTubers KSI and Logan Paul. Prime Energy contains 200mg of caffeine per can, which is around twice the amount in rival energy drink Red Bull. Each drink carries a warning stating that it is not recommended for children under the age of 18. However, Mr Schumer alleged that Prime Energy was packaged and marketed ""in near identical form"" as a caffeine-free drink from the brand. As a result, some parents had unknowingly bought the caffeinated drink for their children, he told reporters in New York on Sunday. ""The FDA must investigate PRIME for its absurd caffeine content and its marketing targeting kids on social media,"" he later said on Twitter. Prime did not immediately respond to the BBC request for comment.",Positive
Poland security patrols on high alert at Belarus border Polish guards describe their concerns over Russia's Wagner group and the threat of unpredictability.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66139757,"– The deal struck to end their mutiny has made Poland extra wary of its neighbor. It's more than two weeks since Yevgeny Prigozhin and his band of mercenaries swept into the southern Russian city of Rostov unhindered, sending a second armed group marching towards Moscow, but the mutineers' fate is still murky. The hasty deal that stopped their advance was meant to see Wagner disbanded and its fighters exiled to Belarus with their leader. But a large tent camp outside Minsk, likely prepared for them, stands empty and no Wagnerites have yet been spotted. Instead, we've found signs that the group are still operating at home, despite going so rogue that President Vladimir Putin accused them of stabbing Russia in the back - and he loathes betrayal. The prospect of mercenaries from the Russian Wagner group moving to Belarus as part of the deal struck to end their mutiny has made Poland extra wary of its neighbor.",Negative

Can Threads make more money than Elon Musk’s Twitter?,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66127141,"– Mark Zuckerberg launched his alternative to Twitter, Threads, it had already claimed some 30 million sign-ups - lending it credibility as a serious contender in the world of social media. But analysts think it's a sign that Mr Zuckerberg's Meta has a good shot at wooing some of its gigantic 3 billion-plus users on Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp to the new offering - and bringing advertisers with them. After all, Mr Zuckerberg, whose Meta made more than $117bn in sales last year, has a monster track record when it comes to selling ads - and none of the apparent qualms of Mr Musk, who has disdained advertising at his electric car company, Tesla, and been looking for alternative ways to fund Twitter.Mr Zuckerberg said there would be no ads on Threads initially, giving the company time to fine-tune the app, which allows users to scroll endlessly through text-based posts.But eventually, Threads adverts could add 1% to 5% to Meta's overall revenue, generating more than $6bn in the most optimistic scenario, Justin Patterson, equity research analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets wrote in a note.Under Mr Musk, Twitter, which had struggled to be profitable, has alienated advertisers with abrupt changes to how the site moderates content and more recently, a new limit on how many posts audiences can see.Mr Musk was ready on Thursday with the counter-punch, reportedly threatening legal action against Meta for stealing trade secrets.",Positive
