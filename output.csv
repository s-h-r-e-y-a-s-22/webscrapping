"Putin vows response after 'terrorist' bridge attack Moscow blames Ukraine for the incident, which killed two people, but Kyiv has not said it was responsible.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66218869,"– Vladimir Putin has vowed to retaliate following a ""terrorist"" attack on the bridge linking Crimea to Russia. Moscow has blamed Ukraine for the incident—which left two people dead—but Kyiv has not officially said it was responsible. The Kerch bridge was opened in 2018 and enables road and rail travel between Russia and Crimea— Ukrainian territory annexed by Russia in 2014. The governor of the western Russian region of Belgorod which is close to Russia's border with Ukraine, said in a Telegram statement that a Russian couple had died in Monday's incident. Unverified photos posted by the spokesperson for Ukraine's military administration in the Odesa region showed debris on the road across the bridge, as well as damaged railings. Russian authorities have accused Ukraine of attacking the Kerch bridge with two ""unmanned surface vessels"" (USVs)—drones that travel over water rather than through the air. But a source in Ukraine's security service told BBC Russian it was behind the attack and that water-based drones were used. The bridge is an important resupply route for Russian forces occupying parts of southern Ukraine.",Negative

The Financial Times, which first reported the story, Dutch internet entrepreneur Johannes Zuurbier identified the problem more than 10 years ago. Since 2013, he has had a contract to manage Mali's country domain and, in recent months, has reportedly collected tens of thousands of emails.

Zuurbier wrote a letter to US officials this month to raise the alarm. He said that his contract with the Mali government was due to finish soon, meaning ""the risk is real and could be exploited by adversaries of the US.""",Negative
