But the BBC's investigation, deep inside Syria's narco-state, has found evidence indicating the involvement of other senior Syrian officials in addition to those already included in that list. Captagon is a highly addictive amphetamine-like drug that has plagued the Middle East in recent years. Over the past year, the BBC has filmed with the Jordanian and Lebanese armies, observing their campaigns to stop Captagon being smuggled across the borders into their countries from Syria. The BBC has found bags of what appeared to be Captagon pills prepared for distribution and a machine which could be used to press pills, as well as Mr Falhout's Syrian military ID card and an unlocked mobile phone. Gaining exclusive access to the phone, the BBC found a series of messages between Mr Falhout and a Lebanese contact he called ""Abu Hamza"", in which they discussed the purchase of the pill-pressing machine. The BBC has found further evidence of Assad family involvement in the business.",Positive
Trump heard on tape discussing secret documents,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66027036,"– An audio recording in which Donald Trump appears to acknowledge keeping a classified document after leaving the White House has been obtained by US media. In the recording, the former president is heard riffling through papers and saying: ""This is highly confidential."" It was first obtained by CNN, but the BBC's US partner CBS also has the clip. Mr Trump has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of mishandling sensitive documents. Prosecutors allege the former president showed classified documents to people without security clearance on two occasions, including a writer and two members of staff. It is not clear from the indictment, however, if the documents referenced in the recording were ever recovered by investigators.",Negative
Trafficked for a kidney and now forced into hiding,https://www.bbc.com/news/65960515,"– Daniel was about to get the fright of his life. He was sitting in a consulting room at the Royal Free hospital in London, speaking to doctors with his limited English. The 21-year-old street trader from Lagos, Nigeria, had come to the UK days earlier for what he had been told was a ""life-changing opportunity."" He thought he was going to get a better job. But now doctors were talking to him about the risks of the operation and the need for lifelong medical care. It was at that moment, Daniel told investigators, that he realized there was no job opportunity and he had been brought to the UK to give a kidney to a stranger. Daniel was taken to several meetings with medical consultants at the private patients' unit at London's Royal Free Hospital. His testimony led detectives to Sonia's father, one of Nigeria's most powerful politicians. The BBC has learned that his ground-breaking case alerted UK authorities to other instances of organ trafficking. Daniel's case reveals the tactics used by traffickers to lure people to the UK under false pretences. Sonia, who was 25 at the time, has a serious form of kidney disease. She needs a transplant and is on dialysis for five hours a day, three or four times a week. The Royal Free Hospital told us it had followed the official guidance in Daniel's case and ""as such a decision was taken not to proceed."" Ekweremadu was a senior senator and a multi-millionaire, who was paying for his family to be schooled in the UK. At his trial earlier this year, Ekweremadu said he had been misled and never intended to exploit Daniel.",Positive
The problem with 'fun' company retreats,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20230623-what-happens-when-fun-corporate-retreats-cross-a-line,"– ""A lot of these people may interact online on a day-to-day basis, but they're only seeing an avatar or a name on screen. This is a chance to bring people together in person, and create a chance to connect at least once per year."" So says Sean Hoff, managing partner at Canada-based firm Moniker, which has organized corporate retreats for companies including Uber, Shopify, and PayPal, in the Guardian. But the worst part was a brainstorming session where I was paired with a really senior member of the team and had to throw out ideas for how to grow the business.""I was worried I'd end up saying the completely wrong thing, and it would come back to haunt me further down the line."" Such corporate getaways are generally well-intentioned. But that aim isn't always the reality for employees required to attend. Some employees say that the post-Covid-19 rise of the corporate getaway isn't a welcome development.",Negative
Indonesia's futuristic take on travel,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20230627-indonesias-futuristic-take-on-travel,"– It had taken the blacksmith-turned-priest 70 hours to create the bell, which was molded with black volcanic soil and formed from gold, silver, copper, zinc and iron. However, his legacy is not only protected by his craftsmanship, but the fact he is now one of 11 artisans from Indonesia who are helping to protect the country's past and future by placing their work on Web3. The artisans have joined with Quantum Temple, a Web3 platform designed to preserve cultural heritage, and Indonesia's Ministry of Tourism to create Paths to Alang, a collection of NFTs, one-of-a-kind digital assets that are sold through Web3. ""We saw this as not just [a way to] to conserve the culture, but also succeed [in the future],"" said Muhammad Neil El Himam, Deputy of Indonesia's Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy.",Positive
Is Hollywood too coy for sex comedies?,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20230627-no-hard-feelings-jennifer-lawrence-in-hollywoods-coyest-sex-comedy,"– In a widely reported comment about her punningly-titled No Hard Feelings, Jennifer Lawrence said: ""Everybody in some sense will be offended by this film—you're welcome."" Wishful thinking on her part. Yet the film also reveals how cautious Hollywood studios remain about sex, especially at a time when the cultural politics of the US is torn between an ever-more conservative right wing and the progressive left. No Hard Feelings only pretends to accept it as the plot heads to a sentimental ending about Maddie and Percy finding themselves. In one of the more realistic, funnier scenes, Maddie and her best friend go through worse reasons they've had sex, including not wanting to make the commute home at night. To them, sex is no big deal, so why not get a car out of it? Except in this movie, it is such a big deal that Percy resists. As Owen Gleiberman said in his Variety review: ""No Hard Feelings is the first Hollywood comedy about a teenager losing his virginity in which the teenager in question has no apparent desire to lose his virginity."" It might sound as if No Hard Feelings is playing into the ""Puriteen"" concept: the idea, which many have questioned, that Generation Z doesn't have much sex. Maddie even asks at a high school party, ""Doesn't anyone [have sex] anymore?""—using a common, but unquotable here, term.",Negative
Is there alien debris in the Pacific?,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230626-the-underwater-search-for-an-alien-object,"– It's a startling fact that no human has ever personally encountered material from outside our Solar System—at least, not knowingly. Despite 66 years of space exploration and hundreds of missions collecting samples from the moon, solar wind, asteroids and low-earth orbit—as well as the more than 70,000 meteorites that have been found on the surface of our planet—the space debris scattered across the world's museums is all from our own cosmic neighborhood. Loeb's team are continuing to search for more possible interstellar relics along the most likely path of IM1's explosion (Credit: Abraham Loeb) Everything we know about the space beyond our own patch comes from observing the light that has made it at least 25 trillion km (25 trillion miles)—the distance from the next nearest Solar System, Alpha Centuri—to our planet. Loeb's team are continuing to search for more possible interstellar relics along the most likely path of IM1's explosion (Learn more from BBC Future about the mysteries of the Oort cloud.)",Positive
How workers win office-return fights,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20230622-why-workers-are-still-winning-the-return-to-office-fight,"– ""Over time, workers found a new way of doing things that stuck,"" she says. ""These new habits seemed right and fair, with the work still getting done. So, any sort of change was perceived as a cost: if returning to the office is good for my manager, then it must be bad for me."" Yet, in late 2022, an economic downturn loomed and layoffs ticked up, companies cross-sector began backtracking on flexibility, mandating more in-office days and set schedules. Some firms that had previously confirmed a work-from-anywhere policy, such as the ride-share company Lyft, went back on those promises, and demanded their workers return to the office. Still, even in the current culture of job cuts, many workers are not heeding the call to return to a commuter lifestyle. The ask has often been met with employee backlash, however, even with the power pendulum beginning to swing away from the workforce. At the height of the Great Resignation and ensuing protracted staffing shortages, it made sense for organizations to accommodate employee demands if they wanted to attract and retain staff. As the economy began to slow down in 2022, however, employers regained some power.",Positive
A Palestinian upside-down rice dish,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20230627-maqloubeh-an-upside-down-chicken-and-rice-dish,"– One delicious version of this convivial meal is regularly prepared by olive farmer Doha Asous, a diminutive, feisty woman based in the village of Burin in the northern West Bank, who passes her passion for and knowledge of organic agriculture onto fellow Palestinian farmers as well as those further afield.Ultimately, it's a ""cake"" of chicken pieces braised with aubergines, potatoes and cauliflower, with alternating layers of rice—though some make it with lamb and other vegetables.Asous' knowledge of farming comes from a lifetime of nurturing some 600 olive trees that produce fat green, purple and black fruit.The magic comes when it is served at the table; with a flourish Asous clears as much kitchen space as she can (Credit: Jan Baldwin)",Positive
