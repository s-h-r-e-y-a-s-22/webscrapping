Spain faces left-right divide in hot summer vote Resurgent nationalists in Spain aim to roll back the left-wing coalition's reforms.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66258206,"– Spaniards are going to the polls in a general election that offers a choice of two starkly contrasting visions. Prime Minister since 2018, he hopes the government's social reforms and its handling of a strongly performing economy will win over voters. But his party has been lagging in polls behind the conservative People's Party led by Alberto Nez Feijo, who may end up needing far-right support. This is the first Spanish general election of modern times held in the searing heat of mid-summer, when many Spaniards are on holiday. Polling for Spain's 37 million voters will continue Sunday until 20:00 (18:00 GMT), although almost 2.5 million have already cast their ballots by post.",Positive
"Russian strikes hit historic Odesa cathedral At least one person was killed and 19 injured in the blasts, including four children.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66281027,"– ""This is the undisguised terror of a peaceful city,"" Mr Yermak wrote on Telegram. ""The enemy must be deprived of the opportunity to attack civilians and infrastructure.""

Cambodia leader faces no challengers at election Voters going to the ballots say they are certain Hun Sen's ruling party will sweep all seats again.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66264726,"– Voting is under way in Cambodia, where the country's long-term leader is virtually certain to extend his party's rule in an election where there are no serious challengers. People turning up to the polls in Phnom Penh told the BBC they expected the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) to sweep all 125 seats in parliament again. Hun Sen, who has been in power for 38 years, faces no real challenge after the only credible opposition party was disqualified in May. But the poll comes as Hun Sen, who cast his vote in the capital early on Sunday morning, shows the clearest signals yet that he's planning to hand power to his eldest son, Hun Manet—possibly within weeks. Hun Sen has become increasingly authoritarian in his rule, political analysts say. Earlier this year, leading opposition figure Kem Sokha was sentenced to 27 years prison on alleged treason charges, and key news outlet Voice of Democracy shut down. It is the second election in a row where Hun Sen has targeted democratic institutions and crippled the opposition before voting day, analysts say. Hun Sen's party has won all six of the national elections held every five years since the 1990s, when the UN helped the Southeast Asian nation of 16 million people become a functioning democracy post decades of civil war and the murderous Khmer Rouge regime.",Negative

Because you're young people, and I'm sure a lot of you are gay and progressive and cool."" Healy then kissed his bandmate MacDonald as the band played the song I Like America & America Likes Me. Shortly after the kiss Healy and the band walked off stage, roughly 30 minutes into the set. The singer told the audience: ""Alright, we just got banned from Kuala Lumpur, see you later.""

Virginia Woolf's personal copy of debut resurfaces,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-66273443,"– Virginia Woolf suffered from severe mental health breakdowns during the estimated seven year period it took to complete The Voyage Out.

Simon Cooper, Metadata Services Officer from the Fisher Library, found the book incorrectly shelved in 2021. He said: ""I knew the book didn't belong there, so I took it out and then saw the author's name handwritten on the first page. So, I looked up her handwriting to compare it, and it matched.""

Woolf and her husband Leonard Woolf had lived in the area - and members of the public can still visit their 16th-century country retreat, Monk's House, which is owned by the National Trust, which is owned by a private collector based in London.",Negative
