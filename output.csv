US urges China to co-operate on climate action Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen calls on Beijing to invest more in efforts to transition from fossil fuels.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66141559,"– Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has called on China to work with Washington to fight the ""existential threat"" of climate change. Speaking on Saturday, she said the two countries - the largest greenhouse gas emitters - had a joint responsibility to lead the way on climate action. Ms Yellen is on a four-day trip to Beijing in an attempt to boost relations between the two countries. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, who was among those to meet with Ms Yellen, said he regretted ""unexpected incidents"", such as the row over a spy balloon, had hurt ties with the United States. There's been no formal co-operation between China and the US on climate change since the administration of former President Trump. But in a sign that co-operation could soon resume, Ms Yellen called on China to work together with the US to fight climate change and mitigate the effects on poorer countries. ""As the world's two largest emitters of greenhouse gases and the largest investors in renewable energy, we have both a joint responsibility - and ability - to lead the way,"" she said. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Beijing last month, making him the highest-ranking Washington official to visit the Chinese capital in almost half a decade.",Negative

Former Belgian Prime Minister Elio di Rupo was the EU's first openly gay head of government. Mr Rinkevics, 49, first came out in 2014 and has been a vocal champion of LGBT rights ever since.",Positive

The maps revealing urban heat stress,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230706-the-simple-ways-cities-can-adapt-to-heatwaves,"– There have been at least 13 heat-related deaths in Texas over the past two weeks, as meteorologists predict the extreme heatwave will spread over the southern US, and that temperatures exceeding 43C (110F) will be commonplace. Images that are constantly being captured by the International Space Station not only show extreme land surface temperatures in cities, but also dramatically cooler areas that are the result of having parks or water features in densely populated areas. One study found that neighborhoods within a 10-minute walk of a park are as much as 3C cooler than areas outside that range. Mapping these extreme hotspots are a vital asset to city planners as the world warms up and heat-related deaths continue to rise.",Positive
