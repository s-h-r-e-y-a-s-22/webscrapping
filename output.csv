"Trump says he expects indictment in January 6 probe Mr Trump posted that he was told to report to a grand jury, ""which almost always means an Arrest"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66236837,"– Donald Trump has said he expects to be arrested by a federal inquiry into the US Capitol riot and efforts to challenge the 2020 election results. The ex-president said in a social media post he had been informed by special counsel Jack Smith on Sunday night that he was a target of their investigation. Mr Trump posted that he was told to report to a grand jury, ""which almost always means an Arrest and Indictment."" Such an indictment would be Mr Trump's third for alleged criminal offences, including 37 counts brought by Mr Smith's team in June accusing the president of mishandling classified documents. Mr Trump has also been charged in New York City with falsifying business records in 2016 hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels. In a post on his Truth Social platform, Mr Trump claimed that he had been sent a letter ""stating that I am a TARGET of the January 6th Grand Jury investigation, and giving me a very short 4 days to report to the Grand Jury, which almost always means an Arrest and Indictment."" Mr Smith was appointed special counsel by US Attorney General Merrick Garland shortly after Mr Trump announced his presidential campaign last autumn.",Negative
Commonwealth Games in doubt after Australian state cancels Victoria says the cost of the tournament had ballooned to three times original estimates.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-66229574,"– Australia has held the Commonwealth Games five times including on the Gold Coast in 2018 and in the Victorian capital of Melbourne in 2006—but all of the country's states on Tuesday ruled out picking up the event. The chief executive of Commonwealth Games Australia agreed, saying the cited cost blowout was a ""gross exaggeration"" and that it would try to find another Australian host for the 2026 games. The Victorian capital, Melbourne, have had a mixed reaction to the decision as she thought the games would bring more money into the state, and another, Kayley Martinez, said she thought ""Victoria would be such a great host of the games."" But another man, David, said he was ""relieved"" by the decision to not host them in Victoria.",Positive
"DeSantis raised more cash than Trump, but it’s not all good news Ron DeSantis's latest cash haul may not show the full picture, our North America correspondent says.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66229424,"– Florida governor Ron DeSantis, who launched his bid for the Republican nomination in May, had some good news at the weekend. But behind Mr DeSantis' healthy top-line numbers is a more complicated, and potentially concerning, story for the Florida governor—one that suggests his presidential campaign, already trailing Mr Trump by double digits in public opinion polls, may not be on sturdy financial footing, either. The first thing to note is that Mr Trump's numbers are not exactly what they appear. Earlier this month, his campaign said it had raised $35m, more than twice the amount it disclosed on Saturday and well ahead of Mr DeSantis' receipts. The reason for the discrepancy is that Mr Trump has been directing most of this money to a fundraising committee that won't report its financial numbers until the end of July. The amount of cash on hand is particularly important for Mr DeSantis, given that his campaign has been spending at a fairly rapid clip.

Lean times hit the vertical farming business,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66173872,"– It was lettuce—but sci-fi. US-based AeroFarms considered itself to be one of the leaders in the industry. In June, the firm filed for bankruptcy protection in the US and Mr Rosenberg stepped down. But lately, AeroFarms has struggled to find enough capital to fuel its soaring ambition. Besides the major economic challenges that have hampered many industries during the last few years, within vertical farming a debate rages over the extent to which some companies may have set themselves up for a fall.
