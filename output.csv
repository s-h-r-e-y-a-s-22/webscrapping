"Nato shows Ukraine it can't get everything it wants President Zelensky wants assurances Ukraine will join Nato after the war, but members chose strategic caution.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66183066,"– Ukraine's president hit the roof, saying it was ""absurd"" for Nato leaders not to give even so much as a timetable. But once President Zelensky met Nato leaders face-to-face, the diplomatic dust settled. They fell over themselves on Wednesday to assure him that things had changed, that Ukraine would join Nato. G7 leaders said they would agree a package of new bilateral assurances of military and economic support for Ukraine, to deter Russian aggression before it joins Nato. That will include more air defenses, long-range missiles and even warplanes, as well as more training, intelligence sharing and help with cyber technology.Mr Zelensky called this ""a significant security victory.""The one discordant note came from Ben Wallace, who gave a briefing to reporters warning Ukraine it should show more gratitude for the support it has already given.He was saying that Ukraine should do more to understand better the political pressures constraining countries giving them military aid, especially the United States.Turning up in Washington with a shopping list of weapons, treating the US like a branch of Amazon, was, he said, inevitably going to cause a few ""grumbles.""",Positive

She described walking up a staircase to class with a friend, when she felt her trousers fall down, a hand touching her buttocks and grabbing her underwear. ""Love, you know I was joking,"" the man told her when she turned around. After the incident, which happened in April 2022, the student reported the caretaker, 66-year-old Antonio Avola, to police.

Webb telescope image dazzles on first birthday,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66179323,"– It's exactly one year since the super observatory was handed over to astronomers to begin using in anger. And to celebrate, the US space agency Nasa has just released a spectacular image of one of the most photographed parts of the sky. It's the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex, which is the nearest star-forming region in space to us, being just 400 light-years away. Both professional and amateur stargazers like to look at Rho Ophiuchi, which can be found just to one side of the plane of the Milky Way. What Webb shows us is only a tiny part of this dense region of gas and dust, which is what you'd expect, given the telescope's astonishing resolution. The entire image is about half a light-year across, or 4.7tn km. ""There's so much going on in this spectacular picture, as young stars splash vibrant colors across the clouds of gas and dust from which they're being born,"" commented Prof Mark McCaughrean, Esa's senior advisor for science & exploration.",Positive
