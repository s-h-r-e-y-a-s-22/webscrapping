"Boat spotted during search for missing migrant vessel Around 200 people including children are thought to be on board the ship, which set off from Senegal.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66150788,"– The Spanish coast guard says one of its aircraft has found a boat during a search for a vessel carrying migrants that went missing more than a week ago. The boat was 71 miles south of Gran Canaria and had around 200 people on board, the coast guard said. It added that one of its vessels has been sent to assist the rescue. The aid group Walking Borders earlier said the fishing boat sailed from a coastal town in southern Senegal that is roughly 1,700km from Tenerife. The voyage from West Africa to the Canary Islands is among the most dangerous routes for migrants, not least because they usually sail in simple dugout fishing boats that are easily tossed by powerful Atlantic currents. Last year at least 559 people died at sea attempting to reach the Spanish islands, the UN's International Organization for Migration (IOM) says.",Negative

Each drink carries a warning stating that it is not recommended for children under the age of 18.

As a result, some parents had unknowingly bought the caffeinated drink for their children, he told reporters in New York on Sunday. ""The FDA must investigate PRIME for its absurd caffeine content and its marketing targeting kids on social media,"" he later said on Twitter. Prime did not immediately respond to the BBC request for comment.",Positive
