"China, Russia in first post-pandemic visits to N Korea North Korea has maintained a strict border closure for years in a bid to keep out the pandemic.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66309231,"– A Russian delegation led by Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu has arrived in North Korea, to be joined by a Chinese delegation later on Wednesday. They will attend Pyongyang's celebrations of the 70th anniversary of the end of the Korean War, marked typically by massive military parades. The visits are the first to North Korea since the country shut its borders in a bid to keep out the pandemic. It is unclear if this signals a change in Pyongyang's border policies. The reclusive North Korea had sealed the country off from all trade and diplomatic ties in early 2020, even with Russia and China, which are its main economic and political partners. Beijing had sent troops in the fall of 1950 to support North Korea in the war against South Korea. Before its collapse, the Soviet Union had also supported North Korea in the war. Moscow, which like Pyongyang holds a strong dislike for the US, is a natural ally for North Korea. The US has, in fact, accused North Korea of providing military aid to Russia in the war in Ukraine, a claim that both Pyongyang and Moscow deny.",Negative
"Speculation rife after China foreign minister removed Qin Gang's prolonged disappearance from public view, and the silence over it, fueled furious speculation.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-66299379,"– It's not unusual for high-profile figures in China to go out of public view for long periods of time, only to surface later as the subject of a criminal investigation.

When he disappeared from his normal duties a month ago and failed to attend a summit in Indonesia, the very brief official explanation given was unspecified health problems. Ian Johnson, a senior fellow for China studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the episode involving Mr Qin adds to ""a string of very public problems"" that Mr Xi has been confronted with in the last 12 months.

UK accused of underestimating Wagner's growth A new report says the UK government has underestimated the group's grip in Africa.,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-66308864,"– The UK government has been sharply criticized by the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee (FAC) for under-estimating the dangerous growth of Russia's Wagner mercenary group. In a scathing report, the cross-party committee of MPs accused the government of what it called ""a dismal lack of understanding"" of Wagner's activities in Africa. ""We are deeply concerned by the government's dismal lack of understanding of Wagner's hold beyond Europe, in particular their grip on African states,"" says the Committee's chair, Alicia Kearns MP. The report itemises seven states where Wagner's military activity has been detected: Ukraine, Syria, the Central African Republic (CAR), Sudan, Libya, Mozambique, and Mali. Wagner has developed a highly successful and profitable business model in these countries, enriching itself and its client rulers, mostly at the expense of the local population. The committee, which for the first time has commissioned open-source investigative research for its 82-page report, asserts that for 10 years the British government has ""under-played and under-estimated the Wagner Network's activities, as well as the security implications for Europe.""",Negative

Wall squats better at lowering blood pressure All exercise is good for blood pressure but research suggests strength training is most effective.,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-66303982,"– Strength-training exercises such as wall squats or holding the plank position are among the best ways to lower blood pressure, a study suggests. Current guidance focusing mainly on walking, running and cycling should be updated, the UK researchers say. Analysis, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, of trials involving 16,000 people found all exercise lowered high blood pressure. But wall squats and planking led to larger falls than aerobic exercise. Current UK guidelines say adults should have at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise a week, or 75 minutes of vigorous activity, plus muscle-strengthening exercise twice a week.",Negative
