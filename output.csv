Chip giant delays US production in blow to Biden Taiwan-based TSMC says semiconductors manufacturing at its Arizona plant will no longer begin in 2024.,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66264392,"– Last year, President Biden signed legislation committing $280bn to high tech manufacturing and scientific research in the US. On Thursday, TSMC Chairman Mark Liu said production of advanced microprocessors at its Arizona factory in the south west of the US would now begin in 2025. During an earnings presentation, Mr Liu said the plant, which has been under construction since April 2021, faced a shortage of workers with the ""specialised expertise required for equipment installation in a semiconductor-grade facility."" He added that the firm was ""working to improve the situation, including sending experienced technicians from Taiwan to train the local skilled workers [in the US] for a short period of time."" TSMC also forecast a 10% drop in sales this year, because of slower demand for semiconductors. The US produces around 10% of the global supply of computer chips, which are key to everything from cars to mobile phones.",Positive
Amsterdam bans cruise ships to limit visitors It comes months after young British men were urged not to hold bachelor parties in the Dutch capital.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66264226,"– Amsterdam's council has banned cruise ships from the city center as the Dutch capital tries to limit visitor numbers and curb pollution. ""Cruise ships in the center of the city don't fit in with Amsterdam's task of cutting the number of tourists,"" said Ilana Rooderkerk of the liberal D66 party, which runs the city along with the Labour party and environmentalists. Ms Rooderkerk recently compared cruise tourists to a type of ""plague of locusts"" descending all at once on the city. Cruise ships have become a symbol of the problem, with more than 100 mooring in the capital every year. The other key reason for removing cruise ships is to lower air pollution levels in Amsterdam.",Negative
US confirms its cluster bombs are in use in Ukraine The White House says the controversial weapons are having an impact on Russian formations.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66262164,"– Ukraine is using US cluster bombs against Russian forces in the country.

The US agreed to supply them to boost Ukrainian ammunition supplies. Ukraine has promised the bombs will only be used to dislodge concentrations of Russian enemy soldiers. ""They're using them effectively and they are actually having an impact on Russia's defensive formations and Russia's defensive manoeuvring. I think I can leave it at that."" The US decided to send cluster bombs after Ukraine warned that it was running out of ammunition during its summer counter-offensive, which has been slower and more costly than many had hoped. President Joe Biden called the decision ""very difficult"" while its allies the UK, Canada, New Zealand and Spain opposed their use. The vast majority sent are artillery shells with a lower than 2.35% ""dud rate"" ""dud rate"", a reference to the percentage of bomblets which do not explode immediately and can remain a threat for years.",Negative
