"What charges could Trump face in January 6 probe? As the former president says he expects to be indicted, we explain what the possible counts could be.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64034782,"– A grand jury is expected to meet again on Thursday in Washington DC as Donald Trump faces the prospect of a new criminal indictment. On Tuesday, the former US president said he expected to be arrested in connection with the federal investigation into efforts to undermine the 2020 presidential election that culminated in a riot at the US Capitol. Mr Trump said he had received a letter indicating he was a target of that investigation - a signal that an indictment may be imminent. The federal inquiry followed a 16-month investigation by the US House of Representatives Select Committee on the January 6 Attack made up of seven Democrats and two Republicans. In its final report last December, that panel recommended four separate charges for Mr Trump and his associates: Insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the US, and conspiracy to make a false statement. The Wall Street Journal, citing a person familiar with the investigation, has reported Mr Trump's target letter mentioned three specific charges: conspiracy to defraud the US, deprivation of rights, and tampering with a witness. The House January 6 committee believed Mr Trump worked with others to impede the function of the US government and mislead the public about the results of the 2020 election.",Negative

Orca mothers keep 5-tonne sons out of trouble,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66249817,"– Older, ""post-menopausal"" orca mothers protect their adult sons from fights, according to new research. It revealed that, when an adult male's post-menopausal mum is with him, he is much less likely to be harmed. But, while four or five-tonne males benefit from this maternal protection, female offspring do not receive the same attention. Lead researcher Charli Grimes from the University of Exeter told BBC News that the protection from these older mothers was very targeted: ""Mum is definitely, in some way, trying to protect her sons."" For the research, published in the journal Current Biology, scientists used photographs of orcas in a population that lives off the Pacific coast of North America. Ms Grimes and her colleagues found there were far fewer ""socially inflicted injuries"" on the bodies of male offspring which were with their mothers, but only when they were post-reproductive.",Positive
