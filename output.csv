What we know so far about Travis King's detention A soldier who crossed the border from South Korea was reportedly facing disciplinary action.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66240928,"– A US soldier is being held in North Korea after crossing the border from South Korea without authorization, the US military has confirmed. The crisis comes during a particularly tense time with the North, one of the world's most isolated states. Private 2nd Class (PV2) Travis King, 23, crossed from South Korea into the North after joining a Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) border tour. At the time he was being escorted back to the US to face disciplinary action, but he did not board the plane. Instead, he reportedly arrived at the boarding gate at Incheon Airport alone as military police officers were not allowed to accompany him all the way to the plane. Local reports quoting officials said he was released on 10 July after serving two months in jail on assault charges. PV2 King has been in the Army since January 2021. The incident came on the day that a US nuclear missile submarine arrived in the South Korean port of Busan—a visible demonstration of US military strength that angered the North Koreans. The host of the North Korea podcast, Jacco Zwetsloot, worked for a tour company in 2012 that took US soldiers to the JSA. He explains that it usually takes three days to be authorized to go on one of these trips. It is possible the soldier's move was pre-planned.",Negative
"Top US college to end family and donor admissions Wesleyan says it will scrap the controversial policy, seen as a perk for the white and wealthy.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66249601,"– Wesleyan University President Michael Roth said ""an applicant's connection to a Wesleyan graduate indicates little about that applicant's ability to succeed"" in a statement on Wednesday. But there would be no legacy ""bump"" in its selection process from now on, he said. Wesleyan joins a number of other US universities that have already dropped legacy admissions, including Johns Hopkins and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT. It is unclear how many students benefit from legacy admission policies each year, but studies suggest that the numbers are significant. An AP review of some of the top universities in the US found that the proportion of legacy cases among first-year students stood at between 4% and 23%. At some prominent universities - including Notre Dame, the University of Southern California and Cornell - there were more legacy students than black students, the AP found. Another study, from MIT, found that over a third of legacy applicants at an unnamed ""elite"" East Coast university were admitted, compared to 14% among non-legacy applicants.",Positive
Astonishing new finds in the ancient city of Pompeii New discoveries in the buried Roman city shed fresh light on life before Vesuvius erupted.,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66226417,"– A kitchen shrine adorned with serpents, a bakery, human skeletons, exquisite frescos, and yes, a picture of something that looks very much like pizza.) Dig anywhere in the ancient city destroyed by Mount Vesuvius in AD79 and you will unearth a treasure—a snapshot of a lost Roman world. It's extraordinary to think that one-third of the city buried under pumice and ash has yet to be excavated. BBC News has been given exclusive access to the investigation with Lion TV, which is making a three-part series to be aired early next year on the BBC. The latest work returns to a sector in the park last explored in the late 19th Century. Back then, archaeologists had opened up the frontage of houses on Via Di Nola, one of Pompeii's main thoroughfares, but hadn't delved far behind. Now, the diggers are progressively pulling away the volcanic ash and pea-sized stones, known as lapilli, that smothered Pompeii during the two catastrophic days of the Vesuvian eruption.",Negative

Video appears to show Wagner boss Prigozhin in Belarus This is the first video evidence of Prigozhin's whereabouts since last month's armed mutiny.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66249551,"– A video on Telegram channels linked to the Wagner mercenary group appears to show its boss Yevgeny Prigozhin in Belarus. He is seen welcoming fighters and describing recent developments on the front line in Ukraine as a ""disgrace."" He also hints that Wagner might rejoin the war at a later date. The video also appears to confirm a statement by Belarus that Wagner fighters were now acting as military instructors for the country's army. The last comment appears to refer to previous allegations by Prigozhin that the Russian defense ministry limited the supply of ammunition to Wagner during the long and bloody battle for the eastern Ukrainian city Bakhmut to limit or thwart its success in the fighting. Prigozhin also hints that his fighters would ""continue to prepare"" and possibly return to the front lines in Ukraine ""when we are sure that we won't be forced to put ourselves and our experience to shame.""",Negative
"'Bold, inventive' Barbie breaks the mould",https://www.bbc.co.uk/culture/article/20230718-greta-gerwigs-bold-inventive-barbie-breaks-the-mould,"– One of the most feverishly anticipated US films of 2023 is Barbie, an authorized tie-in to a range of plastic dolls. And it must say something even more serious about the state of Hollywood that Barbie fully vindicates that feverish anticipation. Yes, we have reached the confusing point in showbusiness history where a two-hour toy commercial is more satisfying than most of the other big-screen entertainment being offered this year. It's not just a genuinely funny and warm-hearted live-action comedy—and there aren't many of those around these days—but an art-house passion project so bold, inventive and politically charged that it is sure to be nominated for all sorts of awards. Director: Greta Gerwig Cast: Margot Robbie; Ryan Gosling; Will Ferrell; Emma Mackey; Michael Cera; America Ferrera Run time: 1hr 54mins Release date: 21 July The zany, joke-packed fish-out-of-water farce keeps a grin stuck on your face, almost as if you were a classic Barbie or Ken yourself. One nice touch is that the inhabitants of Barbieland know that they're connected to dolls being played with by children in reality, but they're blithely fuzzy on the details.",Positive
