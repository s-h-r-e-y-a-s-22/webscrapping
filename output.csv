"The Black Mirror plot about AI that worries actors As actors strike in Hollywood, unions say they want more protection from artificial intelligence.",https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-66200334,"– Hollywood actors are striking for the first time in 43 years, bringing the American movie and television business to a halt, partly over fears about the impact of artificial intelligence (AI). The Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) actors' union failed to reach an agreement in the US for better protections against AI for its members - and warned that ""artificial intelligence poses an existential threat to creative professions"" as it prepared to dig in over the issue. Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the chief negotiator for the SAG-AFTRA union, criticized producers for their proposals over AI so far. He said studios had asked for the ability to scan the faces of background artists for the payment of one day's work, and then be able to own and use their likeness ""for the rest of eternity, in any project they want, with no consent and no compensation."" Perhaps it is only a question of time before ChatGPT or Bard can conjure up an innovative movie script or turn an idea into a blockbuster screenplay.",Positive
"$39bn in US student loan relief for thousands The relief will help some 800,000 borrowers enrolled in income-driven repayment plans, officials say.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66205087,"– The Biden administration has announced it has forgiven $39bn (£29.7bn) in student loan debt for 804,000 borrowers who have income-driven repayment plans. The announcement comes weeks after the US Supreme Court struck down President Joe Biden's broader student loan plan. The move would fix administrative errors that meant some borrowers' payments did not count toward them qualifying for student loan relief, the education department said. ""For far too long, borrowers fell through the cracks of a broken system that failed to keep accurate track of their progress towards forgiveness,"" US Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said in a statement. The US government offers multiple types of income-driven repayment plans, known as IDR plans, under which borrowers make a monthly loan payment based on their income over the course of 20 or 25 years. The administration first announced it would make changes to the plan in April 2022 to address ""historical inaccuracies in the count of payments that qualify toward forgiveness under IDR plans.""",Positive

A surfboard-stealing otter is on the run,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66182428,"– She has developed a knack for theft and a taste for surfboards.Small and dark, whiskered and fluffy, she has developed a knack for theft and a taste for surfboards.This week, the US Fish and Wildlife Service announced it had launched a multi-agency search for Otter 841 in an attempt to capture and rehome her, after observing her ""concerning and unusual behavior."" Teams from the US and state wildlife agencies have been sent out to sea, armed with a bait surfboard, but so far, she has evaded apprehension. Otter 841's capture will mark the end of her brief reign of terror and delight along the balmy coast of Santa Cruz - a story of fearlessness, crime and, possibly, a southern sea otter's family legacy.The complete tale of Otter 841 begins a little over five years ago, with a different otter, Otter 723 (otters who are released into the environment get numbers for names, those who stay in captivity get names).Living in the wild in the central coast of California, Otter 723 was fed by humans and soon became habituated to people, and their snacks.And in her first year back in the sea, Otter 841 swam, ate and floated around California's central coast without incident, alongside a small population of other otters.She was raised in the Monterey Bay Aquarium, where researchers took precautions to stop her mother's love of humans from being passed on.The behavior was highly unusual.",Negative
An unsolved murder in Canada fuels rifts with India,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66158842,"– Canada is home to the largest Sikh diaspora outside the state of Punjab. On 8 July, hundreds protested Mr Nijjar's death in Toronto outside India's High Consulate building. Some posters for the Toronto event featured the words ""Kill India"" and labeled Indian diplomats in Canada as ""killers"", leading the outraged Indian government to the Canadian envoy.Mr Nijjar was a prominent leader in BC and a vocal backer of a separate Khalistan state.The outrage following the 45-year-old's killing has brought to light a long-standing issue of some groups demanding a separate homeland for Sikhs, who are a religious minority that make up about 2% of India's population.Mr Singh, with the World External Organization of Canada, said Mr Nijjar had been the target of threats, and that he had warned members of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service as early as last summer that there was likely an assassination plot against the leader.Mr Nijjar is the third prominent Sikh Sikh Sikh figure to have died suddenly in recent months, though he said the debate on the formation of an independent Punjab state, part of a global series of votes aimed at measuring around 160,000 people, has not yet been released.Mr Singh, with the World External Organization of Canada, said he believes the Khalistan movement has been somewhat dormant and largely peaceful in recent decades, though it has seen a revival, particularly among the proponents.Mr Nijjar was shot dead in June in his truck by two masked gunmen.",Negative

The unlikely hit film that became a political flashpoint,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66169916,"– Sound of Freedom tells the story of a government agent who busts a child sexual abuse ring operating in Colombia. The main character is based on Timothy Ballard, a former Department of Homeland Security agent who founded an anti-human trafficking organization, Operation Underground Railroad (OUR). He goes undercover, and some of the gritty action scenes in the Colombian jungle wouldn't look out of place in a more conventional Hollywood flick. But this is not a typical summer blockbuster. A string of conspiratorial comments by the leading actor Jim Caviezel and the movie's themes have turned the film into another culture war flashpoint.
