Will Texas' floating border barrier deter migrants? Some fear the controversial new barrier may make the crossing more dangerous for migrants.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66183563,"– Texas officials have begun installing a floating barrier along the banks of the Rio Grande river, which they argue will deter migrants from crossing into the US from Mexico. The barrier, made of large orange buoys, is already the subject of a lawsuit from a local kayak company. Officials say the barrier will help secure the US-Mexico border. Last Friday, the owner of a local kayak tour operator filed a lawsuit against Texas government over the buoys, arguing that it will damage his business and destroy local ecosystems. Adriana Martinez, a professor at Southern Illinois University who has researched the impact of projects on the Rio Grande—and is a native of Eagle Pass—said the barriers may change the flow of the river, potentially making it more dangerous for migrants crossing. Texas Department of Public Safety spokesperson Chris Olivarez said that installation began on 10 July. Setting up the barriers may take up to two weeks.",Negative

Before and after images show floods devastation,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66138261,"– Officials in Vermont and New York have just begun clean-up efforts after historic rainfall caused dangerous flash flooding that killed one person.

The problem statue in America's most sacred shrine,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66004176,"– When Judith Ezekiel was five years old, her grandfather drove her and her two brothers to Arlington National Cemetery, to see a statue made by their relative. Moses Jacob Ezekiel, Judith's cousin four times removed, was a renowned Jewish sculptor in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries. His most famous work, what he called the ""crowning achievement"" of his career, has stood inside Arlington since 1914: the Confederate Memorial. The monument, a bronze statue and plinth on top of a granite base, commemorates the men who fought and died for the slave-holding southern states in the US Civil War. But by next year, by order of the US government, the monument must be removed. The decision is part of an ongoing movement to rethink how the US remembers the Confederacy. Some 377 memorials have been renamed or removed since 2015. But as of 2022, some 723 remain, according to a report by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Ms Ezekiel, a historian and professor emerita of women's and African American studies, thought little more of the statue until decades after her visit, in 2017.",Negative
