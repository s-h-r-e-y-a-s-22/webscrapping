Commonwealth Games in doubt after Australian state cancels Victoria says the cost of the tournament had ballooned to three times original estimates.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-66229574,"– Australia has held the Commonwealth Games five times including on the Gold Coast in 2018 and in the Victorian capital of Melbourne in 2006—but all of the country's states on Tuesday ruled out picking up the event.

"DeSantis raised more cash than Trump, but it’s not all good news Ron DeSantis's latest cash haul may not show the full picture, our North America correspondent says.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66229424,"– Florida governor Ron DeSantis, who launched his bid for the Republican nomination in May, had some good news at the weekend. But behind Mr DeSantis' healthy top-line numbers is a more complicated, and potentially concerning, story for the Florida governor—one that suggests his presidential campaign, already trailing Mr Trump by double digits in public opinion polls, may not be on sturdy financial footing, either. The first thing to note is that Mr Trump's numbers are not exactly what they appear. Earlier this month, his campaign said it had raised $35m, more than twice the amount it disclosed on Saturday and well ahead of Mr DeSantis' receipts. The reason for the discrepancy is that Mr Trump has been directing most of this money to a fundraising committee that won't report its financial numbers until the end of July. The amount of cash on hand is particularly important for Mr DeSantis, given that his campaign has been spending at a fairly rapid clip.
