US approves first over-the-counter birth control The government said the move would help reduce women's barriers to accessing contraception.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66191585,"– The over-the-counter birth control pill Opill will be available without a prescription for women of all ages. In a statement, the agency said the move would help reduce women's barriers to accessing contraception. The manufacturer of Opill has said it will most likely be available over the counter in early 2024. The US joins more than 100 countries around the world that have made the birth control pill available over the counter, including most countries in Latin America, as well as India, China, and the United Kingdom. During the hearing, some scientists had raised concerns about whether young people and those with limited literacy could understand the directions, including not taking the prescription if they had a history of breast cancer. The FDA decision was lauded by several medical and advocacy groups on Thursday, including Advocates for Youth, a nonprofit organization pushing for reproductive health rights, which called the approval ""long overdue."" Doctors and activists have argued making birth control available without a prescription will have a host of health benefits for women and teenagers like Ms Huitron, including reducing unintended pregnancies.",Positive
"Hollywood actors set to strike alongside writers The SAG-AFTRA union is expected to opt for strike action on Thursday, after studio talks broke down.",https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-66185585,"– Tens of thousands of Hollywood actors are preparing to strike after last-ditch talks between their union and streaming giants broke down around a major deadline. The Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) has agreed to one extension of talks with major studios. But the union has been unable to agree a deal over issues around pay residuals and the use of artificial intelligence. From Thursday, its members are expected to join screenwriters on picket lines. Now, the negotiating committee of SAG-AFTRA - the union which represents 160,000 actors and performers - has voted unanimously to recommend strike action to its board. The union's board is meeting at 12:00 EST (16:00 GMT) to decide whether to formally approve the strike. It will announce its decision in a news conference at 15:00 EST. Hollywood has not seen a ""double strike"" of actors and writers since 1960, and the joint move would see almost all US film and TV productions grind to a halt. The union's president, Fran Drescher, accused streaming companies of refusing ""to meaningfully engage on some topics and on others completely stonewalled us.""",Positive
The problem statue in America's most sacred shrine A Confederate memorial in Arlington National Cemetery is coming down. But what happens next?,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66004176,"– When Judith Ezekiel was five years old, her grandfather drove her and her two brothers to Arlington National Cemetery, to see a statue made by their relative. Moses Jacob Ezekiel, Judith's cousin four times removed, was a renowned Jewish sculptor in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries. His most famous work, what he called the ""crowning achievement"" of his career, has stood inside Arlington since 1914: the Confederate Memorial. The monument, a bronze statue and plinth on top of a granite base, commemorates the men who fought and died for the slave-holding southern states in the US Civil War. But by next year, by order of the US government, the monument must be removed. The decision is part of an ongoing movement to rethink how the US remembers the Confederacy. Some 377 memorials have been renamed or removed since 2015. But as of 2022, some 723 remain, according to a report by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Ms Ezekiel, a historian and professor emerita of women's and African American studies, thought little more of the statue until decades after her visit, in 2017.",Negative

America's oldest craft brewery shuts after 127 years The owner of Anchor Brewing said it could not overcome the hit from the pandemic.,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66193315,"– A beer-maker founded in San Francisco in 1896 that promotes itself as America's ""first"" craft brewer is closing its doors. Anchor Brewing Company said it would cease operations and liquidate the business, pointing to years of falling sales. Japanese brewing giant Sapporo, which purchased Anchor in 2017, said efforts to revive the brand had failed. ""This was an extremely difficult decision,"" Anchor Brewing spokesman Sam Singer said. ""We recognize the importance and historic significance of Anchor to San Francisco and to the craft brewing industry, but the impacts of the pandemic, inflation, especially in San Francisco, and a highly competitive market, left the company with no option but to make this sad decision to cease operations."" Anchor, with its roots in the Gold Rush, was a pioneer of that trend, raising its profile beyond San Francisco in the 1970s and 1980s, with backing from an heir to the Maytag appliance fortune and an appearance with Arnold Schwarzenegger in television drama The Streets of San Francisco."" Craft beers accounted for just over 13% of the beers sold in the US last year and roughly a quarter of sales by value, according to the Brewers Association. But the beer industry has been under pressure, as pre-packaged cocktails gain popularity.",Positive
