She was born in London but found fame singing in French, and relocated there in the 1970s. Her personal and artistic relationship with Gainsbourg—who died in 1991—made her famous around the world following their international hit ""Je t'aime... moi non plus.""

"Can US and China set aside rivalry for climate action? The two biggest economies and polluters need to work together to avert the crisis, experts say.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-66185535,"– John Kerry's office says he wants to engage with China on ""increasing implementation and ambition"" and ensuring a successful COP28, the UN climate change conference scheduled for the end of the year. But they are also the world's two largest carbon emitters, making them the ""G2 of energy consumption, energy use and pollution,"" noted Dan Kammen, energy professor at the University of California, Berkeley. The two countries are the biggest investors in renewable energy, with China alone making up more than half of the world's total renewable energy investment, according to one assessment. But they are also the world's two largest carbon emitters, making them the ""G2 of energy consumption, energy use and pollution,"" noted Dan Kammen, energy professor at the University of California, Berkeley. China has now shifted to prioritising its energy security. Last year, China approved a dramatic increase in its coal power output, the equivalent of approving two large coal power plants a week, according to one analysis. Analysts say Mr Kerry may try to persuade China to fully capitalize on its clean energy resources and achieve carbon neutrality more quickly. China aims to peak its carbon emissions by 2030 and become carbon neutral by 2060— goals which some say are too far off and give it too much leeway. Earlier this month Ms Yellen urged Beijing to donate to international climate funds set up by richer countries to help poorer economies struggling with climate change.",Positive
Why Hollywood actors have walked off set,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66208226,"– The last time both writers and actors manned the picket line, the strike lasted 10 weeks and was led by then-actor Ronald Reagan. But at the press conference announcing the strike, SAG's chief negotiator, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, explained why the union flatly rejected the idea. ""They proposed that our background performers should be able to be scanned, get one day's pay, and their company should own that scan, their image, their likeness and should be able to use it for the rest of eternity, in any project they want with no consent and with no compensation."" SAG-AFTRA says members are striking for more equitable division of the profits from movies and television. But studio executives have said their demands are unreasonable, leaving Tinseltown at an impasse. Here's why Hollywood is on strike.",Negative

What prompted the end of Britpop?,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-66186676,"– Britpop was coined by journalist Stuart Maconie in a long polemic about the state of guitar music in the April 1993 issue of Select magazine.The movement was often framed as a push back against the dreary self-seriousness of US grunge, with bands drawing consciously on the tradition of melodic, guitar-based British pop established by the Beatles, and spicing it up with elements of glam and punk rock.It was a rallying call, for sure, but the movement didn't burst into life straight away—perhaps because, in addition to Britpop, Maconie insisted on calling these bands ""the bulletproof Jolenests.""But the scene really came together a year later.In the space of two weeks, Blur released Parklife, Oasis put out their debut single, Supersonic, and Pulp issued their breakthrough album His 'N' Hers. Britpop dominated the musical landscape so definitively that bands felt confident enough to play at Knebworth.But almost as soon as it arrived, Britpop fizzled out.In a new BBC Sounds series, The Rise And Fall of Britpop, Jarvis Cocker explains, ""Britpop had this euphoria of thinking, 'Yeah, we're the snotty kids and we're finally getting to go center stage.' Then everybody was drinking too much and getting a hangover—and then, of course, people don't want to buy records by hungover people.""",Positive

The family of director Stanley Kubrick have given their blessing for one of his classic films to be adapted for the stage for the first time. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today program on Saturday Iannucci joked: ""In these sad times, what better way to cheer the nation up than a stage show about the end of the world."" Kubrick's widow Christiane said: ""We have always been reluctant to let anyone adapt any of Stanley's work, and we never have. But we could not resist authorising this project: the time is right; the people doing it are fantastic; and Strangelove should be brought to a new and younger audience. ""People often laugh when they would rather cry, and this is exactly how the film, and now the play, handles the possibility of the ultimate destruction of life on Earth; certainly, an important topic amongst many, to concentrate the mind.""",Positive
