"July heat near 'impossible' without climate change Scientists say the heatwaves seen in Europe, the US and China in July are no longer unusual.",https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66289489,"– The North American heatwave was 2C (3.6F) hotter and the heatwave in China was 1C hotter because of climate change, the scientists concluded. The world has warmed 1.1C compared to the pre-industrial period before humans began burning fossil fuels. If temperature rise reaches 2C, which many experts warn is very likely as countries fail to reduce their emissions quickly enough, these events will occur every two to five years, the scientists say. The study also considered the role of El Nio, a naturally occurring powerful climate fluctuation that began in June. The study concluded that El Nio probably played a small part but that increased temperatures from burning fossil fuels was the main driver in the more intense heatwaves.",Positive
Justice department sues Texas over border barrier Texas officials argue the barrier will help deter migrants from crossing into the US from Mexico.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66296989,"– The Biden administration has sued Texas over a floating barrier installed by the state in the Rio Grande river to deter migrants on the US-Mexico border. The barrier, made partly of orange buoys attached by webbings, was announced by state's Republican governor Greg Abbott in early June. Federal authorities say the barriers in the river flout federal law and present ""humanitarian concerns."" Ahead of the lawsuit, Mr Abbott vowed to ""see"" the government in court. On Monday, Mr Abbott struck a defiant tone and blamed President Joe Biden for a ""record-breaking level of illegal immigration"" that made the barrier necessary. On Tuesday, a White House spokesman said the buoys are ""making it hard for the men and women of Border Patrol to do their jobs of securing the border, and putting migrants and border agents in danger.""",Negative
"Paris to bring back swimming in Seine after 100 years Banned for a century because of filthy water, bathing is to resume in parts of the river.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66238618,"– With a year to go to the Olympics, Paris is in the final phase of a historic clean-up which will soon see swimmers and divers back in the River Seine. Not only are three Olympic and Paralympic events— triathlon, marathon swimming and Para-triathlon—scheduled to take place in the Seine in central Paris, but by 2025 three open-air swimming areas will be accessible from the quayside. ""When people see athletes swimming in the Seine with no health problems, they'll be confident themselves to start going back in the Seine,"" predicts Pierre Rabadan, deputy Paris mayor in charge of the Olympics. The problem has been to build a vast underground reservoir which will serve to store run-off in times of heavy rain. The mega basin will be operational by next year's Games, which start in late July and will showcase the revitalised river not just as a sporting venue but also as the forum for the opening ceremony, with a flotilla of 160 boats carrying 10,000 athletes down a 6km (3.7 mile) stretch to the Eiffel Tower.",Negative
