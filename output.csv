"Polarised Spain eyes the hard-right ahead of vote Spain goes to the polls to decide its next government on Sunday, and a hard-right coalition is looking likely.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66268330,"– Spain's election on Sunday is provoking political tremors even before polls open. The most likely government to emerge—most analysts predict—will be a coalition including a hard-right nationalist party for the first time in Spain since the death of fascist dictator Francisco Franco in 1975. The political right, meanwhile, has said voters have a choice: Sanchez (the current center-left prime minister and his coalition including the far-left) or Spain. Implying that under another Sanchez government, the country will crumble. The rhetoric this election season has been toxic, with voters becoming increasingly polarised. It's a fight over values, traditions and about what being Spanish should mean in 2023.",Negative

In an initial statement to local media on Friday, festival organizers said the band's set was stopped due to ""non-compliance with local performance guidelines.""

Drones are showing us sharks like never before,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66252146,"– ""It's a full 180 degrees when you see the sharks in the wild,"" he said. ""They're just chillin'."" In recent years, amateurs, photographers, some scientists, and even law enforcement have embraced drones as a way to study and track sharks, giving us an unprecedented view of one of the world's most infamous but least understood predators. The technology has resulted in stunning aerial images—great white sharks tearing at a humpback whale carcass, or floating peacefully just feet away from surfers. But drones are also exposing our unease with sharing the waters, and have sparked a debate about how the devices can best be used to protect the safety of beachgoers as encounters with the creatures increase. Roughly a dozen species of sharks swim off the coast of New York's Long Island, including sand tiger sharks, dusky sharks, sandbar sharks, while juvenile great white sharks have also been spotted in these waters. Gov. Kathy Hochul is sending drones to municipality officials to spot sharks near shore and order swimmers out of the water if needed. But some experts said the technology is not particularly effective for monitoring sharks, as it only captures the fish during a limited part of their movements, when they swim close to the surface.",Positive
