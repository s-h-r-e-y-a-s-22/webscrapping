Architect held in Long Island serial killer case Police have been working for over a decade to solve the murders of 11 victims in Long Island.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66190844,"– A suspect has been charged in connection with a series of long-unsolved murders in New York state. Long Island architect Rex Heuermann faces six counts of murder in the deaths of three of four women whose remains were found in 2010. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Police said Mr Heuermann, 59, was arrested at his home on Thursday night. Eleven victims have been found in the inquiry into the Gilgo Beach murders. On Friday, Suffolk County Police Commissioner Rodney Harrison described Mr Heuermann as a ""demon that walks among us"" that has ""ruined families."" Court documents show that Mr Heuermann is facing three counts of first-degree murder and three counts of second-degree murder in the deaths of Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman, and Amber Costello. After a plea was entered on his behalf, Mr Heuermann reportedly broke down in tears in court, telling his attorney: ""I didn't do this."" All three women were found dead in 2010 near a fourth victim, Maureen Brainard-Barnes. The women have been dubbed the Gilgo Beach Four. Speaking at a news conference on Friday, US District Attorney Ray Tierney said that ""each of the four victims were found similarly positioned, bound in a similar fashion by either belts or tape, with three of the victims found wrapped in a burlap-type material.""",Negative
"The Black Mirror plot about AI that worries actors As actors strike in Hollywood, unions say they want more protection from artificial intelligence.",https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-66200334,"– Hollywood actors are striking for the first time in 43 years, bringing the American movie and television business to a halt, partly over fears about the impact of artificial intelligence (AI). The Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) actors' union failed to reach an agreement in the US for better protections against AI for its members - and warned that ""artificial intelligence poses an existential threat to creative professions"" as it prepared to dig in over the issue. Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the chief negotiator for the SAG-AFTRA union, criticized producers for their proposals over AI so far. He said studios had asked for the ability to scan the faces of background artists for the payment of one day's work, and then be able to own and use their likeness ""for the rest of eternity, in any project they want, with no consent and no compensation."" Perhaps it is only a question of time before ChatGPT or Bard can conjure up an innovative movie script or turn an idea into a blockbuster screenplay.",Positive
"$39bn in US student loan relief for thousands The relief will help some 800,000 borrowers enrolled in income-driven repayment plans, officials say.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66205087,"– The Biden administration has announced it has forgiven $39bn (£29.7bn) in student loan debt for 804,000 borrowers who have income-driven repayment plans. The announcement comes weeks after the US Supreme Court struck down President Joe Biden's broader student loan plan. The move would fix administrative errors that meant some borrowers' payments did not count toward them qualifying for student loan relief, the education department said. ""For far too long, borrowers fell through the cracks of a broken system that failed to keep accurate track of their progress towards forgiveness,"" US Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said in a statement. The US government offers multiple types of income-driven repayment plans, known as IDR plans, under which borrowers make a monthly loan payment based on their income over the course of 20 or 25 years. The administration first announced it would make changes to the plan in April 2022 to address ""historical inaccuracies in the count of payments that qualify toward forgiveness under IDR plans.""",Positive

Fran Drescher: The Nanny star taking on Hollywood,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66200190,"– The Screen Actors Guild was once led by former US President Ronald Reagan, then best known as a swashbuckling cowboy from cheesy movies. And less than 24 hours into the guild's campaign against Hollywood's streaming giants, its current leader, Fran Drescher, has caught public attention with a fiery speech from her base in Los Angeles. Branding corporations including Netflix, Disney and Paramount as ""disgusting"", she accused the streaming powerhouses of ""losing money left and right"", all the while ""giving hundreds of millions of dollars to their CEOs."" The speech, which quickly went viral, is emblematic of the wider labor fissures playing out across the world. The 65-year-old's rise to union leadership is anything but traditional. Drescher has long expressed opinions to the political left, frequently captioning photos with phrases like ""Capitalism has become another word for Ruling Class Elite!"" In a 2017 interview with Vulture, she described herself as an ""anti-capitalist"", noting that she was not ""anti-making-money"", but that it must be ""calibrated within the spectrum of what's a true value.""",Positive

An unsolved murder in Canada fuels rifts with India,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66158842,"– Canada is home to the largest Sikh diaspora outside the state of Punjab. On 8 July, hundreds protested Mr Nijjar's death in Toronto outside India's High Consulate building. Some posters for the Toronto event featured the words ""Kill India"" and labeled Indian diplomats in Canada as ""killers"", leading the outraged Indian government to the Canadian envoy.Mr Nijjar was a prominent leader in BC and a vocal backer of a separate Khalistan state.The outrage following the 45-year-old's killing has brought to light a long-standing issue of some groups demanding a separate homeland for Sikhs, who are a religious minority that make up about 2% of India's population.Mr Singh, with the World External Organization of Canada, said Mr Nijjar had been the target of threats, and that he had warned members of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service as early as last summer that there was likely an assassination plot against the leader.Mr Nijjar is the third prominent Sikh Sikh Sikh figure to have died suddenly in recent months, though he said the debate on the formation of an independent Punjab state, part of a global series of votes aimed at measuring around 160,000 people, has not yet been released.Mr Singh, with the World External Organization of Canada, said he believes the Khalistan movement has been somewhat dormant and largely peaceful in recent decades, though it has seen a revival, particularly among the proponents.Mr Nijjar was shot dead in June in his truck by two masked gunmen.",Negative

Christopher Nolan says he will not make films during strike,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-66191705,"– Christopher Nolan says he ""absolutely"" will not work on another film until the Hollywood strikes are resolved. Tens of thousands of Hollywood actors have joined writers in taking industrial action, because they want streaming giants to agree to a fairer split of profits and better working conditions. Nolan admitted he was ""very fortunate with the timing"", as his film's premieres were held just before the strike began, meaning Oppenheimer would not be affected by industry members stopping work. When asked if he would write another film during the strike, he told BBC Culture editor Katie Razzall: ""No, absolutely. It's very important that everybody understands it is a very key moment in the relationship between working people and Hollywood."" Another existential threat to civilization is AI, which is also part of the Hollywood strike and makes the Oppenheimer movie more timely. Nolan told the BBC: ""It's very important to bear in mind that there are people who have been out of work for months now, as part of the writers strike, and with the actors potentially joining—a lot of people are going to suffer.""",Positive
