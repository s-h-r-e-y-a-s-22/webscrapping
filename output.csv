Iraq expels Swedish envoy as Quran row escalates The ambassador is told to leave amid protests that began over the burning of a Quran in Stockholm.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-66259886,"– The Iraqi government has ordered the Swedish ambassador in Baghdad to leave as a diplomatic dispute over the recent burning of a Quran in Stockholm intensifies. Hundreds of people breached the embassy after they heard that an Iraqi Christian refugee had been given permission by Swedish police to burn a Quran in Stockholm for a second time. Swedish police had initially rejected applications by Mr Momika to burn the Quran, but were over-ruled by the courts. Meanwhile, Turkey said it strongly condemned Mr Momika's ""despicable attack"" while Iran's foreign ministry summoned Sweden's ambassador in Tehran on Thursday to ""strongly protest against the desecration of the holy Quran."" The European Union and the US condemned the attack on the embassy. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammad Shia al-Sudani then released a statement on Thursday asking Iraq's Swedish ambassador to leave the country.",Negative
Tupac police seize hard drives and laptops at house Police search the home of a man who says he was inside the car with the person who shot the rapper.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66263481,"– Las Vegas police searching for evidence in the unsolved 1996 murder of Tupac Shakur were targeting an alleged gang member's home, a warrant says. The home searched on Monday belongs to Duane Keith Davis, 60, said to have been inside a car carrying the gunman. In the police interview, he said that the fatal shots were fired by his nephew, Orlando Anderson, who had been in a fight with Shakur the same night of his murder and who was later himself killed in a separate crime. Davis, who is also known as ""Keefy D"" or ""Keffe D,"" is allegedly affiliated with the South Side Compton Crips street gang. He had initially been investigated by police in Los Angeles and Las Vegas over Shakur's killing, but was cleared after denying involvement. In a 2018 Netflix documentary and in his book released in 2019, Mr Davis indicated that he was inside the car with the gunman who killed Shakur. The search warrant obtained by BBC News on Thursday shows that police were looking for ""notes, writings, ledgers, and other handwritten or typed documents concerning television shows, documentaries, YouTube episodes, book manuscripts, and movies concerning the murder of Tupac Shakur.""",Negative
"What charges could Trump face in January 6 probe? As the former president says he expects to be indicted, we explain what the possible counts could be.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64034782,"– A grand jury is expected to meet again on Thursday in Washington DC as Donald Trump faces the prospect of a new criminal indictment. On Tuesday, the former US president said he expected to be arrested in connection with the federal investigation into efforts to undermine the 2020 presidential election that culminated in a riot at the US Capitol. Mr Trump said he had received a letter indicating he was a target of that investigation - a signal that an indictment may be imminent. The federal inquiry followed a 16-month investigation by the US House of Representatives Select Committee on the January 6 Attack made up of seven Democrats and two Republicans. In its final report last December, that panel recommended four separate charges for Mr Trump and his associates: Insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the US, and conspiracy to make a false statement. The Wall Street Journal, citing a person familiar with the investigation, has reported Mr Trump's target letter mentioned three specific charges: conspiracy to defraud the US, deprivation of rights, and tampering with a witness. The House January 6 committee believed Mr Trump worked with others to impede the function of the US government and mislead the public about the results of the 2020 election.",Negative
Xi meets Kissinger as US seeks to defrost China ties The 100-year-old diplomat's surprise trip to Beijing follows a flurry of visits by US officials.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-66106076,"– Chinese president Xi Jinping has given a warm welcome to former top diplomat Henry Kissinger, as the US pursues closer ties with China. State television showed Mr Xi smiling as he told Mr Kissinger: ""I'm very glad to see you, sir."" They met at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, a more intimate space than the sprawling Great Hall of the People where official meetings with foreign diplomats are usually hosted. Diaoyutai was also the place where, half a century ago, Mr Kissinger met Chinese officials in a secret visit that helped to kick-start the normalisation of US-China ties, noted Mr Xi. With its overtly warm reception of Mr Kissinger, Beijing has clearly signaled it wants more engagement from the US, with Mr Wang saying ""the US' China policy needs Kissinger's diplomatic wisdom and Nixon's political courage."" But this will not change the fact that China will, in the end, stick to its priorities, said Wen-ti Sung, a political scientist with the Australian National University.",Positive

Tree row turns up heat on Hollywood strike,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-66255244,"– Film and TV giant NBCUniversal has denied trying to stop striking actors and writers protesting outside its studios by cutting trees that provided shade during blazing temperatures. Treegate, as the row has been dubbed, is a sign of growing tensions between Hollywood studios and artists. Los Angeles city controller Kenneth Mejia said ""no tree trimming permits"" had been issued for the location. NBCUniversal officials said the work was simply ""annual landscaping."" But the studio said in a statement to the LA Times that the work had ""created unintended challenges for demonstrators."" Members of the Writers Guild of America and actors' union Sag-Aftra have been demonstrating outside one NBCUniversal building, as well as other offices and studios. Sag-Aftra said in a statement to the Hollywood Reporter: ""Suspiciously timed construction that has forced picketers into streets without proper safety rails, and now tree trimming eliminating shade during a record heatwave, has forced Sag-Aftra to determine that it cannot safely send its members to picket at NBCUniversal."" NBCUniversal said ""the safety tree trimming of the Ficus trees"" had not meant to provide a problem for protestors.",Negative
Orca mothers keep 5-tonne sons out of trouble,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66249817,"– Older, ""post-menopausal"" orca mothers protect their adult sons from fights, according to new research. It revealed that, when an adult male's post-menopausal mum is with him, he is much less likely to be harmed. But, while four or five-tonne males benefit from this maternal protection, female offspring do not receive the same attention. Lead researcher Charli Grimes from the University of Exeter told BBC News that the protection from these older mothers was very targeted: ""Mum is definitely, in some way, trying to protect her sons."" For the research, published in the journal Current Biology, scientists used photographs of orcas in a population that lives off the Pacific coast of North America. Ms Grimes and her colleagues found there were far fewer ""socially inflicted injuries"" on the bodies of male offspring which were with their mothers, but only when they were post-reproductive.",Positive
