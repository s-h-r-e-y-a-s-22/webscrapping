Did Yellen's trip to Beijing boost US-China relations? Polite communication has returned to US-China relations - but progress could easily be knocked back.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66146889,"– US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has just concluded a four-day trip to China, aimed at rebuilding bridges between the two countries. Was the trip to Beijing a success? Well, by one very basic metric, yes. The US and China are once again talking to each other, face to face, politely and respectfully, if not warmly. America's motivation is simple: It doesn't want China to have easy access to American technologies that could give it an edge in things like AI, and in military technologies that could one day be used against the US in a future conflict over, for example, Taiwan. It appears the Biden administration is trying to demonstrate that its China policy is not simply a continuation of the Trump administration's open hostility to Beijing.",Positive
