Why is US giving Ukraine 'abhorrent' weapons? Cluster bombs are banned by more than 100 countries - so the move will likely draw intense criticism.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66133527,"– The US has announced it is complying with a Ukrainian request to supply it with controversial cluster munitions. The move has been criticized by human rights groups as the weapon is banned by more than 100 countries. Cluster munitions are a method of dispersing large numbers of tiny bomblets from a rocket, missile, or artillery shell that scatters them in mid-flight over a wide area. They are intended to explode on impact but a significant proportion are ""duds"", meaning they don't explode initially—this happens especially if they land on wet or soft ground. They can then explode at a later date on being picked up or trodden on, killing or maiming the victim. More than 100 countries, including the UK, France, and Germany, have signed an international treaty—the Convention on Cluster Munitions—that outlaws the use or stockpiling of these weapons due to their indiscriminate effect on civilian populations. Ukraine's forces are running desperately low on artillery shells, largely because, like the Russians, they use them up at an extraordinarily high rate and Ukraine's Western allies cannot replace them at the speed they are needed.",Negative
Zelensky visits Snake Island as war enters 500th day The island became a symbol of Ukraine's resistance after troops there defied a Russian order to surrender.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66141701,"– Volodymyr Zelensky has posted a video of himself visiting an island that became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance - as the war enters its 500th day. At the start of the war, Ukrainian soldiers defending Snake Island famously defied an order from a Russian warship to surrender. In a video, the Ukrainian president called it a ""place of victory"" that would never be reconquered. In the undated clip, posted on Telegram, Mr Zelensky described it as proof that Ukraine will return every inch of its territory taken by Russia since the war began on 24 February 2022. ""I want to thank from here, from this place of victory, each of our soldiers for these 500 days,"" Mr Zelensky said in the video, in which he was shown arriving on the island by boat and leaving flowers at a memorial. Last year, Russia's flagship Moskva sailed to Snake Island within hours of the start of the war and ordered Ukrainian soldiers on the island to give themselves up. Snake Island was seized and the Ukrainian soldiers were taken prisoner - but later exchanged for Russian captives.",Negative

"Can France prevent tensions igniting again? The riots in the country's suburban estates have subsided, for now, but deep divisions remain.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66133676,"– ""When the yellow vest strikes happened, they understood why we in the suburbs were, like, to wake up to his message."" That was around the time that France scrapped community policing, known in the country as the ""police of proximity"" - something Djigui believes was a big mistake. Djigui grew up in La Grande Borne, which is one of the poorest housing estates in France. ""My first encounter with police was when I was 10 years old,"" he explained, as we sat in the simple concrete playground he used to visit as a child, surrounded by low-rise apartment blocks. Djigui is now working on a new series about policing in France's suburbs, and said he believes that those beyond the banlieues are starting to wake up to his message. The shooting, and the riots that followed, dominated French media for days. But many believe media coverage here is just as important as policing and policy in fuelling divisions between the banlieues and the rest of France.",Negative

The maps revealing urban heat stress,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230706-the-simple-ways-cities-can-adapt-to-heatwaves,"– There have been at least 13 heat-related deaths in Texas over the past two weeks, as meteorologists predict the extreme heatwave will spread over the southern US, and that temperatures exceeding 43C (110F) will be commonplace. Images that are constantly being captured by the International Space Station not only show extreme land surface temperatures in cities, but also dramatically cooler areas that are the result of having parks or water features in densely populated areas. One study found that neighborhoods within a 10-minute walk of a park are as much as 3C cooler than areas outside that range. Mapping these extreme hotspots are a vital asset to city planners as the world warms up and heat-related deaths continue to rise.",Positive

Why America could be overtaken as the corn superpower,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66089408,"– It's not just China backing away from US corn: Reuters recently reported that exports to all destinations excluding China were at their second-lowest in two decades. American farmers' hard work and technological expertise has cemented its place at the top of the pile when it comes to corn exports. But its corn superpower status may be coming to an end. In fact, after decades at the top, it is on the verge of being overtaken as the world's biggest exporter of the crop. Buyers in China - the world's biggest importer of corn - have been canceling orders from the US, in large part because there are cheaper alternatives elsewhere. It is a troubling trend for US farmers.
