Murders and mayhem tearing apart an Indian state Ethnic divisions in Manipur have led to complete segregation of the warring communities.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-66086142,"– The BBC's Soutik Biswas traveled to the tribal district of Churachandpur, where the violence began, to explore how the profound division has led to fury and isolation. On a cloudy afternoon last week, hundreds of men and women congregated outside a hastily-built bamboo hut memorial in Churachandpur, nestled amidst Manipur's picturesque hills in north-eastern India. Violence between the two communities sparked by an affirmative action controversy have roiled Manipur since early May. The violence has left more than 130 people dead, and nearly 60,000 have become refugees in their own land. Now the Kuki have demanded ""territorial autonomy"" for the group, a euphemism for a separate, independent administration. Internet has been cut all over the state, further heightening the isolation. At the memorial, Kuki mourners sobbed at the pictures of the victims who included a two-month-old boy and a 104-year-old man.",Negative
Will Texas' floating border barrier deter migrants? Some fear the controversial new barrier may make the crossing more dangerous for migrants.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66183563,"– Texas officials have begun installing a floating barrier along the banks of the Rio Grande river, which they argue will deter migrants from crossing into the US from Mexico. The barrier, made of large orange buoys, is already the subject of a lawsuit from a local kayak company. Officials say the barrier will help secure the US-Mexico border. Last Friday, the owner of a local kayak tour operator filed a lawsuit against Texas government over the buoys, arguing that it will damage his business and destroy local ecosystems. Adriana Martinez, a professor at Southern Illinois University who has researched the impact of projects on the Rio Grande—and is a native of Eagle Pass—said the barriers may change the flow of the river, potentially making it more dangerous for migrants crossing. Texas Department of Public Safety spokesperson Chris Olivarez said that installation began on 10 July. Setting up the barriers may take up to two weeks.",Negative
