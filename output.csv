"Why are actors so worried about AI? The US actors' union says artificial intelligence poses an ""existential threat"" to the profession.",https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-66200334,"– Hollywood actors are striking for the first time in 43 years, bringing the American movie and television business to a halt, partly over fears about the impact of artificial intelligence (AI). The strike comes after US actors' union the Screen Actors Guild failed to reach an agreement on increased safeguarding around AI rights. The union warned that ""artificial intelligence poses an existential threat to creative professions."" So what is it about a tech-dominated future that raises so much concern? There have already been examples of voiceover artists being replaced by AI generated work and the tech is already being used in films - for example, in synthesised voices and in visual effects such as deepfakes and de-ageing. Liam Budd, industrial official of audio and new media at acting union Equity, said he was most concerned about ""performance cloning"" where AI is used to create a performance with an actor's image or voice. The Writers' Guild of Great Britain (WGGB) - a trade union representing writers for TV, film, theater, books and video games in the UK - has several concerns, including: The WGGB has made a number or recommendations to help protect writers, including AI developers only using writers' work if they have been given express permission and AI developers being transparent about what data is being used to train their tools.",Positive
Lisa Marie Presley's cause of death revealed The only child of music icon Elvis Presley died after being rushed to a hospital on 12 January.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66195853,"– Lisa Marie Presley, the only child of rock 'n' roll legend Elvis, died of a bowel obstruction, the Los Angeles County medical examiner's office has said.

At the time of Presley's death, local officials said first responders had been dispatched to her home in Calabasas, where they found her in cardiac arrest. On Thursday, the medical examiner's office ruled that she died of natural causes and said that the cardiac arrest was caused by a ""small bowel obstruction."" This occurs when the small intestine is blocked, sometimes as a result of colon cancer, medication or adhesions (scar tissue) that form after surgeries. In Presley's case, the report found that the adhesions were caused by weight-loss surgery, known as bariatric surgery, that she underwent several years ago.",Negative

Republican rivals need Trump to debate. But will he? Polls show Donald Trump way ahead. His opponents hope that will change when debates begin next month.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66195481,"– Donald Trump has taken a commanding lead in the race to be the Republican presidential nominee for 2024. His opponents need to make a game-changing impression at the TV debates. First, each of the 14 candidates must gather enough donors and hit certain opinion polling metrics to qualify for the stage. But with Mr Trump threatening to skip the debates in order to preserve his huge lead, it is unclear how much these forums will influence the race. The first debate of the Republican presidential primary will be held on Wednesday 23 August, with a second possibly to follow the next night. The first one will take place in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which is also where the party will host its formal nominating convention next year. Wisconsin is a battleground state that the eventual Republican nominee will probably need to win at the November 2024 general election in order to get to the White House. Polls indicate a majority of Democratic voters, including those who support Mr Biden, want to see the nation's oldest ever president participate in debates as he seeks re-election.",Positive

A surfboard-stealing otter is on the run,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66182428,"– She has developed a knack for theft and a taste for surfboards.Small and dark, whiskered and fluffy, she has developed a knack for theft and a taste for surfboards.This week, the US Fish and Wildlife Service announced it had launched a multi-agency search for Otter 841 in an attempt to capture and rehome her, after observing her ""concerning and unusual behavior."" Teams from the US and state wildlife agencies have been sent out to sea, armed with a bait surfboard, but so far, she has evaded apprehension. Otter 841's capture will mark the end of her brief reign of terror and delight along the balmy coast of Santa Cruz - a story of fearlessness, crime and, possibly, a southern sea otter's family legacy.The complete tale of Otter 841 begins a little over five years ago, with a different otter, Otter 723 (otters who are released into the environment get numbers for names, those who stay in captivity get names).Living in the wild in the central coast of California, Otter 723 was fed by humans and soon became habituated to people, and their snacks.And in her first year back in the sea, Otter 841 swam, ate and floated around California's central coast without incident, alongside a small population of other otters.She was raised in the Monterey Bay Aquarium, where researchers took precautions to stop her mother's love of humans from being passed on.The behavior was highly unusual.",Negative
How a murder in Canada fuelled tensions with India,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66158842,"– Canada is home to the largest Sikh diaspora outside the state of Punjab. On 8 July, hundreds protested Mr Nijjar's death in Toronto outside India's High Consulate building. Some posters for the Toronto event featured the words ""Kill India"" and labeled Indian diplomats in Canada as ""killers"", leading the outraged Indian government to the Canadian envoy.Mr Nijjar was a prominent leader in BC and a vocal backer of a separate Khalistan state.The outrage following the 45-year-old's killing has brought to light a long-standing issue of some groups demanding a separate homeland for Sikhs, who are a religious minority that make up about 2% of India's population.Mr Singh, with the World External Organization of Canada, said Mr Nijjar had been the target of threats, and that he had warned members of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service as early as last summer that there was likely an assassination plot against the leader.Mr Nijjar is the third prominent Sikh Sikh Sikh figure to have died suddenly in recent months, though he said the debate on the formation of an independent Punjab state, part of a global series of votes aimed at measuring around 160,000 people, has not yet been released.Mr Singh, with the World External Organization of Canada, said he believes the Khalistan movement has been somewhat dormant and largely peaceful in recent decades, though it has seen a revival, particularly among the proponents.Mr Nijjar was shot dead in June in his truck by two masked gunmen.",Negative

The unlikely hit film that became a political flashpoint,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66169916,"– Sound of Freedom tells the story of a government agent who busts a child sexual abuse ring operating in Colombia. The main character is based on Timothy Ballard, a former Department of Homeland Security agent who founded an anti-human trafficking organization, Operation Underground Railroad (OUR). He goes undercover, and some of the gritty action scenes in the Colombian jungle wouldn't look out of place in a more conventional Hollywood flick. But this is not a typical summer blockbuster. A string of conspiratorial comments by the leading actor Jim Caviezel and the movie's themes have turned the film into another culture war flashpoint. Sound of Freedom tells the story of a government agent who busts a child sexual abuse ring operating in Colombia. Rolling Stone called it a ""QAnon-tinged thriller"" - a reference to the sprawling conspiracy theory that says that Donald Trump is fighting an elite cabal of satanic paedophiles.

He goes undercover, and some of the gritty action scenes in the Colombian jungle wouldn't look out of place in a more conventional Hollywood flick. But the company behind the film denies it's fueling conspiratorial thinking.",Negative
