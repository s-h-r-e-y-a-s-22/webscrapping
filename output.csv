Bickering Nato aims for Ukraine unity as Putin watches on,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66135326,"– NATO is just hours away from its high-profile annual summit—a stress test for the alliance, with Russian President Vladimir Putin watching intently from the sidelines. With Joe Biden, Emmanuel Macron, Rishi Sunak, Olaf Scholz and so many more world leaders attending, ambassadors of the alliance's 31 member states have been huddled together, arguing about what they can, should or will announce publicly on Ukraine. The conundrum: How do you send Moscow a clear message that the West won't stand by and allow the Kremlin to grab sovereign territory in Ukraine or anywhere else in Europe, while at the same time avoiding coming into direct conflict with nuclear power Russia and risking all-out war?
