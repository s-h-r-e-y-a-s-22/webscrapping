"Pastor at girl's funeral charged with her murder Gretchen Harrington, eight, was abducted by a family friend during a Bible camp in 1975, police say.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66301562,"– A retired US church pastor who presided nearly half a century ago at the funeral of a kidnapped eight-year-old girl has been charged with her murder. Gretchen Harrington went missing in the Philadelphia suburb of Reformed Township on the morning of 15 August 1975 while attending summer Bible camp. Earlier this year, an anonymous woman told investigators she believed her best friend's father was the culprit. David Zandstra, 83, is now charged with murder and kidnapping of a minor. He killed this poor eight-year-old girl he knew and who trusted him. And then, he acted as if he was a family friend, not only during her burial and the period after that, but for years."" Interest in the case was revived in part by a book published last year, called Tragedy's Gretchen Harrington: Kidnapping, Murder and Innocence Lost in Suburban Philadelphia. Zandstra was pastor at the Trinity Christian Church. Bible camps were held on its premises each morning and he would then transport the children to a second church. But Gretchen never showed up at the Reformed Presbyterian Church, and it was Mr Zandstra himself who reported her disappearance to police that morning. Her remains would be found in a nearby wooded area nearly two months later. The suspect was a family friend of the Harringtons, helped search for her and even presided over the child's funeral, sources told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. Investigators say Mr Zandstra had invited Gretchen into his car once she was out of view of her late father, who had watched her walk up the road from the family home.",Negative
July heat near impossible without climate change,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66289489,"– The North American heatwave was 2C (3.6F) hotter and the heatwave in China was 1C hotter because of climate change, the scientists concluded. The world has warmed 1.1C compared to the pre-industrial period before humans began burning fossil fuels. If temperature rise reaches 2C, which many experts warn is very likely as countries fail to reduce their emissions quickly enough, these events will occur every two to five years, the scientists say. The study also considered the role of El Nio, a naturally occurring powerful climate fluctuation that began in June. The study concluded that El Nio probably played a small part but that increased temperatures from burning fossil fuels was the main driver in the more intense heatwaves.",Positive

Paris to bring back swimming in Seine after 100 years,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66238618,"– With a year to go to the Olympics, Paris is in the final phase of a historic clean-up which will soon see swimmers and divers back in the River Seine. Not only are three Olympic and Paralympic events— triathlon, marathon swimming and Para-triathlon—scheduled to take place in the Seine in central Paris, but by 2025 three open-air swimming areas will be accessible from the quayside. ""When people see athletes swimming in the Seine with no health problems, they'll be confident themselves to start going back in the Seine,"" predicts Pierre Rabadan, deputy Paris mayor in charge of the Olympics. The problem has been to build a vast underground reservoir which will serve to store run-off in times of heavy rain. The mega basin will be operational by next year's Games, which start in late July and will showcase the revitalised river not just as a sporting venue but also as the forum for the opening ceremony, with a flotilla of 160 boats carrying 10,000 athletes down a 6km (3.7 mile) stretch to the Eiffel Tower.",Negative
