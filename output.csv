"Boat spotted during search for missing migrant vessel Around 200 people including children are thought to be on board the ship, which set off from Senegal.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66150788,"– One of its aircraft has found a boat during a search for a vessel carrying migrants that went missing more than a week ago. The boat was 71 miles south of Gran Canaria and had around 200 people on board, the coast guard said. It added that one of its vessels has been sent to assist the rescue. The aid group Walking Borders earlier said the fishing boat sailed from a coastal town in southern Senegal that is roughly 1,700km from Tenerife. It said the vessel had 200 people on board when it left Kafountine on 27 June, heading for the Canary Islands. There are few details about the other two boats - however, Walking Borders was quoted by the Reuters news agency as saying that one had about 65 people on board, the other up to 60. The voyage from West Africa to the Canary Islands is among the most dangerous routes for migrants, not least because they usually sail in simple dugout fishing boats that are easily tossed by powerful Atlantic currents.",Positive
Threads app signs up 100m users in less than a week Meta's rival to Twitter has surpassed a record set by Open AI's ChatGPT app since its launch.,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-66153244,"– Threads, the social media app aimed at rivalling Twitter, has signed up more than 100 million users in less than five days, according to new data. It means Threads, launched by Instagram-owner Meta, has beaten a record set by Open AI's ChatGPT app. Threads went live on Apple and Android app stores in 100 countries last Wednesday. But it is not available in Europe yet because of uncertainty over EU data privacy legislation. Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Meta, which also owns Facebook, said the app had 10 million users within the first seven hours of launch and more than 30 million by Thursday morning. At 100 million, according to figures from data platform Quiver Quantitative, Threads' base stands at less than a third of the 350 million users that Twitter is believed to have. Twitter claimed that Meta had hired former employees who ""had and continue to have access to Twitter's trade secrets and other highly confidential information.""",Negative
Schumer calls for Prime Energy drink probe Chuck Schumer alleges the drink is being targeted at children despite its high caffeine content.,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66150857,"– Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has called on regulators to investigate an energy drink promoted by high-profile YouTubers KSI and Logan Paul. Prime Energy contains 200mg of caffeine per can, which is around twice the amount in rival energy drink Red Bull. Each drink carries a warning stating that it is not recommended for children under the age of 18. However Mr Schumer, a Democrat, alleged that Prime Energy was packaged and marketed ""in near identical form"" as a caffeine-free drink from the brand. As a result, some parents had unknowingly bought the caffeinated drink for their children, he told reporters in New York on Sunday. ""The FDA must investigate PRIME for its absurd caffeine content and its marketing targeting kids on social media,"" he later said on Twitter. Prime did not immediately respond to the BBC request for comment.",Positive

Experts say these video clips—on platforms including TikTok, YouTube and WhatsApp—are the public face of a highly sophisticated, multi-billion dollar illegal industry that has taken advantage of confusion over changes in US immigration policies to spread disinformation and drive demand for their services. Current and former law enforcement sources in the US and Mexico estimated that typical prices are now around $15,000, rising to between $50,000 and $60,000 for many migrants.",Positive

Can Threads make more money than Elon Musk’s Twitter?,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66127141,"– Mark Zuckerberg launched his alternative to Twitter, Threads, it had already claimed some 30 million sign-ups - lending it credibility as a serious contender in the world of social media. But analysts think it's a sign that Mr Zuckerberg's Meta has a good shot at wooing some of its gigantic 3 billion-plus users on Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp to the new offering - and bringing advertisers with them. After all, Mr Zuckerberg, whose Meta made more than $117bn in sales last year, has a monster track record when it comes to selling ads - and none of the apparent qualms of Mr Musk, who has disdained advertising at his electric car company, Tesla, and been looking for alternative ways to fund Twitter.Mr Zuckerberg said there would be no ads on Threads initially, giving the company time to fine-tune the app, which allows users to scroll endlessly through text-based posts.But eventually, Threads adverts could add 1% to 5% to Meta's overall revenue, generating more than $6bn in the most optimistic scenario, Justin Patterson, equity research analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets wrote in a note.Under Mr Musk, Twitter, which had struggled to be profitable, has alienated advertisers with abrupt changes to how the site moderates content and more recently, a new limit on how many posts audiences can see.Mr Musk was ready on Thursday with the counter-punch, reportedly threatening legal action against Meta for stealing trade secrets.",Positive
Did Yellen's trip to Beijing boost US-China relations?,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66146889,"– US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has just concluded a four-day trip to China, aimed at rebuilding bridges between the two countries. Was the trip to Beijing a success? Well, by one very basic metric, yes. The US and China are once again talking to each other, face to face, politely and respectfully, if not warmly. It's a stark contrast to trans-Pacific communication during the Donald Trump administration, which was done largely via the megaphone of social media. At the end of her trip on Sunday, Ms Yellen said it would help to build a ""resilient and productive channel of communication with China's new economic team.""",Positive
