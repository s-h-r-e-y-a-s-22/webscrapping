Tree row turns up heat on Hollywood strike A film studio cut trees that had given striking actors and writers shade during blazing temperatures.,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-66255244,"– Treegate, as the row has been dubbed, is a sign of growing tensions between Hollywood studios and artists. Los Angeles city controller Kenneth Mejia said ""no tree trimming permits"" had been issued for the location. NBCUniversal officials said the work was simply ""annual landscaping."" But the studio said in a statement to the LA Times that the work had ""created unintended challenges for demonstrators."" Members of the Writers Guild of America and actors' union Sag-Aftra have been demonstrating outside one NBCUniversal building, as well as other offices and studios. Sag-Aftra said in a statement to the Hollywood Reporter: ""Suspiciously timed construction that has forced picketers into streets without proper safety rails, and now tree trimming eliminating shade during a record heatwave, has forced Sag-Aftra to determine that it cannot safely send its members to picket at NBCUniversal."" NBCUniversal said ""the safety tree trimming of the Ficus trees"" had not meant to provide a problem for protestors.",Negative
"'We have no more room,' NYC mayor tells migrants America's biggest city will hand migrants fliers asking them to go elsewhere as it is ""at capacity"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66259075,"– New York City plans to distribute fliers at the southern border warning migrants there is ""no guarantee"" they will receive help if they come there.

""We have no more room,"" said the leader of America's biggest city. A copy of the flier tells migrants: ""Please consider another city as you make your decision about where to settle in the US."" It warns - in English and in Spanish - that the cost of food, transportation and other necessities in New York are expensive and says the city cannot guarantee housing and other social services for new arrivals. The city of 8.3 million people said in a statement that it was ""at capacity."" In recent months, Mr Adams has taken a number of steps to try to limit new migrant arrivals.",Negative
"What charges could Trump face in January 6 probe? As the former president says he expects to be indicted, we explain what the possible counts could be.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64034782,"– A grand jury is expected to meet again on Thursday in Washington DC as Donald Trump faces the prospect of a new criminal indictment. On Tuesday, the former US president said he expected to be arrested in connection with the federal investigation into efforts to undermine the 2020 presidential election that culminated in a riot at the US Capitol. Mr Trump said he had received a letter indicating he was a target of that investigation - a signal that an indictment may be imminent. The federal inquiry followed a 16-month investigation by the US House of Representatives Select Committee on the January 6 Attack made up of seven Democrats and two Republicans. In its final report last December, that panel recommended four separate charges for Mr Trump and his associates: Insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the US, and conspiracy to make a false statement. The Wall Street Journal, citing a person familiar with the investigation, has reported Mr Trump's target letter mentioned three specific charges: conspiracy to defraud the US, deprivation of rights, and tampering with a witness. The House January 6 committee believed Mr Trump worked with others to impede the function of the US government and mislead the public about the results of the 2020 election.",Negative
Xi meets Kissinger as US seeks to defrost China ties The 100-year-old diplomat's surprise trip to Beijing follows a flurry of visits by US officials.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-66106076,"– Chinese president Xi Jinping has given a warm welcome to former top diplomat Henry Kissinger, as the US pursues closer ties with China. State television showed Mr Xi smiling as he told Mr Kissinger: ""I'm very glad to see you, sir."" They met at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, a more intimate space than the sprawling Great Hall of the People where official meetings with foreign diplomats are usually hosted. Diaoyutai was also the place where, half a century ago, Mr Kissinger met Chinese officials in a secret visit that helped to kick-start the normalisation of US-China ties, noted Mr Xi. With its overtly warm reception of Mr Kissinger, Beijing has clearly signaled it wants more engagement from the US, with Mr Wang saying ""the US' China policy needs Kissinger's diplomatic wisdom and Nixon's political courage."" But this will not change the fact that China will, in the end, stick to its priorities, said Wen-ti Sung, a political scientist with the Australian National University.",Positive
Orca mothers keep 5-tonne sons out of trouble,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66249817,"– Older, ""post-menopausal"" orca mothers protect their adult sons from fights, according to new research. It revealed that, when an adult male's post-menopausal mum is with him, he is much less likely to be harmed. But, while four or five-tonne males benefit from this maternal protection, female offspring do not receive the same attention. Lead researcher Charli Grimes from the University of Exeter told BBC News that the protection from these older mothers was very targeted: ""Mum is definitely, in some way, trying to protect her sons."" For the research, published in the journal Current Biology, scientists used photographs of orcas in a population that lives off the Pacific coast of North America. Ms Grimes and her colleagues found there were far fewer ""socially inflicted injuries"" on the bodies of male offspring which were with their mothers, but only when they were post-reproductive.",Positive
