"Russia strikes Ukraine grain after ending sea deal Attacks on Black Sea ports destroy 60,000 tonnes of grain and damage infrastructure, officials say.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66242446,"– Russia's defense ministry declared that from midnight on Wednesday night (21:00 GMT), any ships heading to Ukrainian ports would be viewed as potential carriers of military cargo and party to the conflict. Ukraine's agriculture minister Mykola Solskyi said a ""considerable amount"" of export infrastructure was out of operation. Russia began targeting Ukraine's ports in the early hours of Tuesday within hours of its withdrawal from the grain deal. More strikes followed overnight into Wednesday, targeting grain terminals and port infrastructure in Odesa and further down the Black Sea coast in Chornomorsk, two of the three ports that were included in the export deal. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky said each missile strike was a blow not just to Ukraine, but to ""everyone in the world striving for a normal and safe life."" Germany Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said that by covering Odesa with a hail of bombs, Russian President Vladimir Putin was robbing the world of any hope of Ukrainian grain and ""hitting the world's poorest."" Russia had called its initial attack on Odesa a ""mass revenge strike"" for an attack on the Russian-built bridge over the Kerch strait linking Crimea to Russia.",Negative

"Canada wants US workers - and they are interested A Canadian work permit for US H1-B visa holders hit its cap of 10,000 applicants in only 48 hours.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66249400,"– When Leon Yang was 16, he moved by himself from Xi'An, China to the US, to study in a country where he believed that, if he worked hard every day, he could get where he wanted. The H1-B allows foreign-born, US-educated individuals to work in the country for three to six years, but requires sponsorship by an employer and often provides no meaningful path to permanent residency. This week, Mr Yang, now 25, submitted his application for a new Canadian program that offers open work permits, for up to three years, to H1-B visa holders and their immediate family members. The measure, a temporary effort to attract skilled and high-tech US workers to the country, only opened on Monday morning. It remains to be seen whether Canada will extend the cap for its work permit program or seek to make it permanent. When it was established by the US Congress in the year 1990, only 65,000 foreign nationals could apply for the visa each year. That limit has since been raised only once - to 85,000 - which Ms Zavodny says is ""way too small."" Ron Hira, a research associate with the non-partisan Economic Policy Institute think tank, says the H1-B program is ""a mixed bag"" that sometimes rewards ""the best and brightest"" but largely benefits workers with skills already abundantly available in the US. He warns that it is far too early to know if Canada has made a good decision, in spite of the optics, and points to its lack of screening criteria for the open work permit as well as mass layoffs in spite of the optics, and says the US is losing graduates of its own universities who want to stay but are forced to return to their home countries or go elsewhere for employment.",Positive

Moscow also warned that from Thursday any ships going there would be seen as siding with ""the Kyiv regime."" The defense ministry in Moscow said that from Thursday all vessels sailing on the Black Sea to Ukrainian ports would be regarded as ""potential carriers of military cargo"" and that the ships' ""flag states... will be considered to be involved in the Ukrainian conflict on the side of the Kyiv regime.""

On Wednesday Mr Putin accused Ukraine of using the Black Sea grain corridor for ""combat purposes.""",Negative
Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66252781,"– Two Internal Revenue Service investigators have testified to Congress that the investigation into Hunter Biden's tax returns were hampered by justice department officials for political reasons. They allege that Mr Biden, who agreed on 20 June to plead guilty to two misdemeanour tax offences and a felony firearm violation, should have been charged with more serious crimes. Instead, they claim, he received more lenient treatment because he is the son of US President Joe Biden. The two IRS employees who testified about the Hunter Biden investigation are Gary Shapley, a supervisory special agent, and Joseph Zielger, a criminal investigator. The two whistleblowers accuse Delaware Assistant US Attorney Lesley Wolf, an assistant to Mr Weiss, of repeatedly blocking further investigation into Hunter Biden. They say she denied a request for a search warrant of Joe Biden's Wilmington home, where Hunter Biden kept some of his financial records, citing ""optics."" Shapley has worked for the IRS for 14 years and serves as a team leader in the agency's International Tax and Financial Crimes group, which oversaw the IRS investigation into Hunter Biden.",Negative

Astonishing new finds in the ancient city of Pompeii,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66226417,"– A kitchen shrine adorned with serpents, a bakery, human skeletons, exquisite frescos, and yes, a picture of something that looks very much like pizza.) Dig anywhere in the ancient city destroyed by Mount Vesuvius in AD79 and you will unearth a treasure—a snapshot of a lost Roman world. It's extraordinary to think that one-third of the city buried under pumice and ash has yet to be excavated. BBC News has been given exclusive access to the investigation with Lion TV, which is making a three-part series to be aired early next year on the BBC. The latest work returns to a sector in the park last explored in the late 19th Century. Back then, archaeologists had opened up the frontage of houses on Via Di Nola, one of Pompeii's main thoroughfares, but hadn't delved far behind. Now, the diggers are progressively pulling away the volcanic ash and pea-sized stones, known as lapilli, that smothered Pompeii during the two catastrophic days of the Vesuvian eruption.",Negative
Severe storms blow debris across US highway,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66251719,"– It's been a rough year for US-Mexico relations, but the two countries have come together to create a plan to mend their differences—or at least avoid a full-scale war. The plan, which still needs to be approved by the US Senate, calls for the US and Mexico to work together to develop a common stance on issues like border security and drug trafficking, the AP reports. The president of the Mexico Association of Chiefs of Police tells the BBC that he's not sure how the plan will be implemented in the short term, but he thinks it will be a ""good first step.""
