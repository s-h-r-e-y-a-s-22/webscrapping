"What happens to US citizens detained in North Korea Americans arrested in the communist state have included tourists, a teacher and a Christian missionary.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66236989,"– President Trump's Singapore summit with Kim Jong Un isn't the only thing he's worried about. The US president is also worried about North Korea's nuclear test and long-term detention of US citizens—and he wants Pyongyang to pay for it, the New York Times reports. ""The US government is unable to provide emergency services to US citizens in North Korea,"" reads a sternly worded travel warning on the US State Department's website. Trump said in a press conference with South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Friday that he is ""concerned about the continued serious risk of arrest and long-term detention of US nationals"" in North Korea, the BBC reports. ""The US government is unable to provide emergency services to US citizens in North Korea,"" reads a sternly worded travel warning on the US State Department's website. In July 2017, the US government banned US citizens from visiting the country—a move that has since been extended until at least August this year. Here are some of the most notable cases from the last decade.",Negative
"The latest North Korea spat is a high-risk moment for Biden Detaining a US soldier moves North Korea up the priority list, our North America correspondent says.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66190848,"– North Korea hasn't been much of a foreign policy priority for Joe Biden's administration since he took office in January 2021, but recent escalating tensions on the Korean peninsula are moving it up the list. Now, with the detention of a US soldier who crossed the border in the demilitarised zone (DMZ), the situation could be turning into a full-blown crisis, the type of which the Biden administration has been trying to avoid. The incident comes on the day that a US nuclear missile submarine, the USS Kentucky, arrived in the South Korean port of Busan - a visible demonstration of US military strength that had angered the North Koreans. The move was a US response to more than a hundred new North Korean missile tests over the past few years that suggest the nation's nuclear-delivery technologies continue to advance - possibly putting the US mainland well within range of a North Korean strike. The reasons behind the American soldier's decision to enter North Korea are unclear, although US officials have said that he was facing military disciplinary proceedings. What is apparent, however, is that his presence gives the North Koreans, and its volatile leader Kim Jong Un, a new bargaining chip to use when dealing with the US. If the soldier is an unwilling detainee, Mr Biden could face growing pressure to arrange his release.",Negative
