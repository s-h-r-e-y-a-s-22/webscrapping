Federal authorities say the barriers in the river flout federal law and present ""humanitarian concerns."" Ahead of the lawsuit, Mr Abbott vowed to ""see"" the government in court. On Monday, Mr Abbott struck a defiant tone and blamed President Joe Biden for a ""record-breaking level of illegal immigration"" that made the barrier necessary. On Tuesday, a White House spokesman said the buoys are ""making it hard for the men and women of Border Patrol to do their jobs of securing the border, and putting migrants and border agents in danger.""",Negative
