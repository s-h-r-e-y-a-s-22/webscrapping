"Pro-war Putin critic Strelkov detained in Moscow A key player in Russia's Ukraine landgrab in 2014, he has bitterly criticised the flagging campaign.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66265892,"– A former FSB intelligence colonel, Strelkov played a key role in Russia's 2014 landgrab of Crimea. He went on to lead Russia's proxy army in the ensuing war in eastern Ukraine. Igor Strelkov was one of three men convicted in absentia by a Dutch court last November of murder for his role in a missile strike in 2014 that downed a Malaysia Airlines passenger jet over the conflict area, with the loss of all 298 people on board. But as the full-scale invasion of last year became increasingly bogged down, Strelkov's criticism of military failings and the commander in chief, President Vladimir Putin, became more vociferous. A few days ago he called the Kremlin leader ""a nonentity"" and ""a cowardly waste of space"", says BBC Russia editor Steve Rosenberg. Strelkov's lawyer, Alexander Molokhov, said that after he had been detained his flat had been searched.

"Berlin 'lioness' probably a boar, authorities say Authorities call off a search for a suspected big cat spotted near the German capital.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66268558,"– Police were searching for more than a day after being notified about a wild animal by members of the public - but found no trace. After speaking to experts, they now believe the creature was a wild boar. The frantic search was triggered by a short grainy video shot by a member of the public in the early hours of Thursday. It appeared to show a wild animal, possibly a lion, roaming in a wooded area in the town of Kleinmachnow. As the search unfolded, two police officers said they saw a ""big cat"" about 65 feet away on the same day. But at a press conference on Friday, Kleinmachnow Mayor Michael Grubert said that ""everything indicates it is not a lioness."" He held up photographs which he said proved that the animal from the video did not have the long, curving neck characteristic of lions. And what looked in the video like a long tail with a bob, the mayor said, could in fact have been a shadow cast by vegetation. Police were searching for more than a day after being notified about a wild animal by members of the public - but found no trace.",Negative
"Tony Bennett was 'singing days before he died' The New York crooner who duetted with Aretha Franklin, Frank Sinatra and Lady Gaga, dies aged 96.",https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-66271090,"– Tony Bennett was known for songs such as The Way You Look Tonight, Body and Soul and (I Left My Heart) In San Francisco.

Tony, because of you we have your songs in our heart forever."" Sir Elton John led the tributes on social media, writing in a statement posted on his Instagram that he was ""so sad to hear of Tony's passing.""

He changed his name to the Americanized Tony Bennett on the say so of fellow entertainer Bob Hope. Bennett's death was confirmed by his publicist Sylvia Weiner in a statement to the AP.",Negative

Drones are showing us sharks like never before,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66252146,"– ""It's a full 180 degrees when you see the sharks in the wild,"" he said. ""They're just chillin'."" In recent years, amateurs, photographers, some scientists, and even law enforcement have embraced drones as a way to study and track sharks, giving us an unprecedented view of one of the world's most infamous but least understood predators. The technology has resulted in stunning aerial images—great white sharks tearing at a humpback whale carcass, or floating peacefully just feet away from surfers. But drones are also exposing our unease with sharing the waters, and have sparked a debate about how the devices can best be used to protect the safety of beachgoers as encounters with the creatures increase. Roughly a dozen species of sharks swim off the coast of New York's Long Island, including sand tiger sharks, dusky sharks, sandbar sharks, while juvenile great white sharks have also been spotted in these waters. Gov. Kathy Hochul is sending drones to municipality officials to spot sharks near shore and order swimmers out of the water if needed. But some experts said the technology is not particularly effective for monitoring sharks, as it only captures the fish during a limited part of their movements, when they swim close to the surface.",Positive

Asia's longest-serving PM rigs the vote - again,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66231548,"– A few years ago, Cambodia's ruler launched the most ruthless crackdown of his career to annihilate his opponents. Facing popular opposition, Hun Sen used the courts to dismantle the political party threatening his rule. For voters heading to the polls again this Sunday—it's déj vu with their only alternative banned. Hun Sen, now 70, has ruled Cambodia since 1985. A former Khmer Rouge official who defected to Vietnam before the regime's fall, his survivalist grip on power has led to his boast that he is the world's longest-serving prime minister. For nearly 40 years, he has consolidated power through a network of interests, including the military, police and intelligence groups. Hun Sen has flagged he will hand over to his son some time after this election. But political analysts say it's now an authoritarian one-party state, and Hun Sen is by most standards, a dictator. ""It's a rigged election because there are no real strong opposition parties,"" one voter, an aid worker in Phnom Penh, told the BBC.",Positive
