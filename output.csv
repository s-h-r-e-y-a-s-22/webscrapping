"Pro-war Putin critic Strelkov detained in Moscow A key player in Russia's Ukraine landgrab in 2014, he has bitterly criticised the flagging campaign.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66265892,"– A former FSB intelligence colonel, Strelkov played a key role in Russia's 2014 landgrab of Crimea. He went on to lead Russia's proxy army in the ensuing war in eastern Ukraine. Igor Strelkov was one of three men convicted in absentia by a Dutch court last November of murder for his role in a missile strike in 2014 that downed a Malaysia Airlines passenger jet over the conflict area, with the loss of all 298 people on board. But as the full-scale invasion of last year became increasingly bogged down, Strelkov's criticism of military failings and the commander in chief, President Vladimir Putin, became more vociferous. A few days ago he called the Kremlin leader ""a nonentity"" and ""a cowardly waste of space"", says BBC Russia editor Steve Rosenberg. Strelkov's lawyer, Alexander Molokhov, said that after he had been detained his flat had been searched.

"Berlin 'lioness' probably a boar, authorities say Authorities call off a search for a suspected big cat spotted near the German capital.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66268558,"– Police were searching for more than a day after being notified about a wild animal by members of the public - but found no trace. After speaking to experts, they now believe the creature was a wild boar. The frantic search was triggered by a short grainy video shot by a member of the public in the early hours of Thursday. It appeared to show a wild animal, possibly a lion, roaming in a wooded area in the town of Kleinmachnow. As the search unfolded, two police officers said they saw a ""big cat"" about 65 feet away on the same day. But at a press conference on Friday, Kleinmachnow Mayor Michael Grubert said that ""everything indicates it is not a lioness."" He held up photographs which he said proved that the animal from the video did not have the long, curving neck characteristic of lions. And what looked in the video like a long tail with a bob, the mayor said, could in fact have been a shadow cast by vegetation. Police were searching for more than a day after being notified about a wild animal by members of the public - but found no trace.",Negative

US teen jailed for illegal disposal of her foetus The Nebraska woman pleaded guilty to to illegally concealing human remains after she had an abortion.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66271537,"– A US teenager was sentenced to 90 days in prison after taking abortion pills to end her pregnancy and disposing of the foetus with her mother's help. Celeste Burgess, now 19, pleaded guilty to illegally concealing human remains after she had an abortion when around 28 weeks pregnant, beyond the 20-week limit then set by Nebraska law. Her mother, Jessica Burgess, 42, faces up to five years in prison for helping her. Police opened the investigation into the mother and daughter in June 2022, before the Supreme Court overturned the nationwide right to abortion and left it to states to determine whether or how to allow the procedure. At the time, both mother and daughter, then 17, resided in Nebraska, where abortions had been banned at 20 weeks from conception. Earlier this year, Nebraska lawmakers passed an abortion ban at 12 weeks after conception. According to court documents, Celeste Burgess was in her third trimester of pregnancy when she consumed the abortion pills, making the procedure illegal as per Nebraska law.",Negative

Asia's longest-serving PM rigs the vote - again,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66231548,"– A few years ago, Cambodia's ruler launched the most ruthless crackdown of his career to annihilate his opponents. Facing popular opposition, Hun Sen used the courts to dismantle the political party threatening his rule. For voters heading to the polls again this Sunday—it's déj vu with their only alternative banned. Hun Sen, now 70, has ruled Cambodia since 1985. A former Khmer Rouge official who defected to Vietnam before the regime's fall, his survivalist grip on power has led to his boast that he is the world's longest-serving prime minister. For nearly 40 years, he has consolidated power through a network of interests, including the military, police and intelligence groups. Hun Sen has flagged he will hand over to his son some time after this election. But political analysts say it's now an authoritarian one-party state, and Hun Sen is by most standards, a dictator. ""It's a rigged election because there are no real strong opposition parties,"" one voter, an aid worker in Phnom Penh, told the BBC.",Positive
