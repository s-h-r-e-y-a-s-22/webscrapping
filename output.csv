Grand jury picked to consider Trump election case A Georgia panel is likely to weigh whether Donald Trump and his allies interfered in the 2020 election.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66168402,"– A US grand jury assembled in Georgia is set to consider evidence against ex-president Donald Trump over efforts to overturn the 2020 election. The grand jury, based in Atlanta, may decide whether Mr Trump should face criminal charges for trying to overturn his narrow loss in the state. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Wallis, a Democrat, launched the investigation in early 2021. The two-and-a-half year probe has grown into a sprawling inquiry into various efforts by Mr Trump and his allies to sway the election results in his favor. Those efforts include a January 2021 call between Mr Trump and the state's chief elections officer, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in which the then-president suggested state officials could ""find"" more than 11,000 votes - enough to give him a victory in that state. The special grand jury found no widespread election fraud in Georgia, but did recommend multiple charges, known as indictments, for alleged perjury. To bring criminal charges against the former president, the district attorney, Ms Willis, and her team must present her case to one of the grand juries assembled on Tuesday.",Negative
