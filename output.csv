"Iran could execute my dad any time, says German woman An Iranian-German businessman on death row may have made his last phone call, his daughter fears.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66268645,"– Gazelle Sharmahd launched a criminal complaint here in Germany, calling on German state prosecutors to investigate eight high-ranking members of the Iranian judiciary and intelligence service for crimes against humanity, because of the way her father has been treated. Iran sentenced Jamshid Sharmahd to death last February for so-called ""corruption on Earth"" - a vague catch-all term the Iranian regime uses for any expression of opposition. Gazelle Sharmahd was overjoyed to talk to her dad again, but she is tormented by the fear that this phone call was allowed in order for her to say goodbye before his execution. For almost three years the 68-year-old has been in solitary confinement in an Iranian jail, cut off from the world. Earlier this month Gazelle Sharmahd launched a criminal complaint here in Germany, calling on German state prosecutors to investigate eight high-ranking members of the Iranian judiciary and intelligence service for crimes against humanity, because of the way her father has been treated. Iranian-Germans tell me they feel ignored by the German government.",Negative
"In Aspen, nervousness over Ukraine's critical moment At the Aspen Security Forum, the war in Ukraine is upper-most in the minds of policymakers.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66273787,"– The rarefied setting of Aspen, Colorado, with its mountain views and manicured lawns, is a world away from the minefields and trenches of Ukraine's front-line, but for a few days this past week the two places were connected. Ukraine is a month into its counter-offensive and it is clear that it's proving, as one speaker put it, a ""hard slog"" with often just a few meters of ground taken each day. The war may look slow but it is not a stalemate - or at least not yet. Ukraine relies on US military aid - and you can glimpse tension over what has been given and when. Where President Zelensky in Aspen renewed his call for more, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan barely an hour or two later said that US military advisers do not believe F-16 fighter jets would play a significant role in current operations. The looming shadow of Donald Trump also hung over Aspen with questions about what his possible re-election would mean not just for Ukraine but for America's position in the world and relationship with its allies.",Neutral
"Senator releases FBI source's claim of Biden bribes The FBI deemed the informant ""highly credible"", but top Republicans concede the claim is unverified.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66272217,"– A top Senate Republican has released an FBI document detailing an allegation President Joe Biden and his son accepted bribes from a Ukrainian firm. Chuck Grassley, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said: ""The American people can now read this document for themselves."" The unclassified memo is a June 2020 internal FBI report outlining claims by a foreign informant. Senior congressional Republicans have acknowledged the allegation is unverified. The memo contains a claim that Hunter Biden was hired by the Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, in 2013 as a way to gain support from his father, who was the US vice-president at the time. It also alleges that Burisma made two $5m (£3.9m) payments to ""the Bidens"" as part of its efforts to remove Ukraine's prosecutor general at the time, Viktor Shokin - and that there were audio recordings of both Hunter and Joe Biden that supported this. The FBI officials have described FD-1023 forms as a means to document ""raw, unverified"" intelligence information that does not reflect the conclusions of investigators.",Positive
"Pro-war Putin critic Strelkov detained in Moscow A key player in Russia's Ukraine landgrab in 2014, he has bitterly criticised the flagging campaign.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66265892,"– A former FSB intelligence colonel, Strelkov played a key role in Russia's 2014 landgrab of Crimea. He went on to lead Russia's proxy army in the ensuing war in eastern Ukraine. Igor Strelkov was one of three men convicted in absentia by a Dutch court last November of murder for his role in a missile strike in 2014 that downed a Malaysia Airlines passenger jet over the conflict area, with the loss of all 298 people on board. But as the full-scale invasion of last year became increasingly bogged down, Strelkov's criticism of military failings and the commander in chief, President Vladimir Putin, became more vociferous. A few days ago he called the Kremlin leader ""a nonentity"" and ""a cowardly waste of space"", says BBC Russia editor Steve Rosenberg. Strelkov's lawyer, Alexander Molokhov, said that after he had been detained his flat had been searched. Strelkov was one of three men convicted in absentia by a Dutch court last November of murder for his role in a missile strike in 2014 that downed a Malaysia Airlines passenger jet over the conflict area, with the loss of all 298 people on board.",Negative

Drones are showing us sharks like never before,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66252146,"– ""It's a full 180 degrees when you see the sharks in the wild,"" he said. ""They're just chillin'."" In recent years, amateurs, photographers, some scientists, and even law enforcement have embraced drones as a way to study and track sharks, giving us an unprecedented view of one of the world's most infamous but least understood predators. The technology has resulted in stunning aerial images—great white sharks tearing at a humpback whale carcass, or floating peacefully just feet away from surfers. But drones are also exposing our unease with sharing the waters, and have sparked a debate about how the devices can best be used to protect the safety of beachgoers as encounters with the creatures increase. Roughly a dozen species of sharks swim off the coast of New York's Long Island, including sand tiger sharks, dusky sharks, sandbar sharks, while juvenile great white sharks have also been spotted in these waters. Gov. Kathy Hochul is sending drones to municipality officials to spot sharks near shore and order swimmers out of the water if needed. But some experts said the technology is not particularly effective for monitoring sharks, as it only captures the fish during a limited part of their movements, when they swim close to the surface.",Positive
