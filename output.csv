"How desperate US prisoners try to escape deadly heat With no air con, a former prisoner describes lying in toilet water to survive brutal heat.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66274629,"– As temperatures rise, prisoners locked in cells without air conditioning—and the staff guarding them—are struggling. Calvin Johnson spent 37 years in a Texas state prison, including 37 summers in a jail cell with no air conditioning. On the countless blisteringly hot days, when temperatures climbed above 37.7C (100F), his survival depended upon a mix of creativity and desperation to stay cool—stay alive. ""Sometimes you can clog the commode and let the water run,"" Mr Johnson, 67, said. ""Put your pants and your shirt across that, and lay in the water for a while."" It's something he did ""a bunch of times."" Of the 100 prisons operated by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, 31 are fully air-conditioned and 55 have air-conditioning limited to certain areas. Since mid-June, at least nine prisoners have died of reported heart attacks or cardiac events in un-cooled Texas prisons where the outdoor heat indices were above 100 degrees, the Texas Tribune reported. The newspaper said at least another 14 died of unknown causes on days of extreme heat, and that they were often found unresponsive in their cells by prison staff. To describe what it's like in a prison when it reaches triple-digit temperatures, he said: ""It's like working in an inferno.""",Negative

July heat near impossible without climate change,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66289489,"– The North American heatwave was 2C (3.6F) hotter and the heatwave in China was 1C hotter because of climate change, the scientists concluded. The world has warmed 1.1C compared to the pre-industrial period before humans began burning fossil fuels. If temperature rise reaches 2C, which many experts warn is very likely as countries fail to reduce their emissions quickly enough, these events will occur every two to five years, the scientists say. The study also considered the role of El Nio, a naturally occurring powerful climate fluctuation that began in June. The study concluded that El Nio probably played a small part but that increased temperatures from burning fossil fuels was the main driver in the more intense heatwaves.",Positive

Satellite images and pictures show Greece fire damage,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66295972,"– Tens of thousands of people have been forced to leave their homes and abandon holidays on Greek islands including Rhodes and Corfu as fires spread across the region.

Paris to bring back swimming in Seine after 100 years,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66238618,"– With a year to go to the Olympics, Paris is in the final phase of a historic clean-up which will soon see swimmers and divers back in the River Seine. Not only are three Olympic and Paralympic events— triathlon, marathon swimming and Para-triathlon—scheduled to take place in the Seine in central Paris, but by 2025 three open-air swimming areas will be accessible from the quayside. ""When people see athletes swimming in the Seine with no health problems, they'll be confident themselves to start going back in the Seine,"" predicts Pierre Rabadan, deputy Paris mayor in charge of the Olympics. The problem has been to build a vast underground reservoir which will serve to store run-off in times of heavy rain. The mega basin will be operational by next year's Games, which start in late July and will showcase the revitalised river not just as a sporting venue but also as the forum for the opening ceremony, with a flotilla of 160 boats carrying 10,000 athletes down a 6km (3.7 mile) stretch to the Eiffel Tower.",Negative
