Anger in Paris after police kill teen in traffic stop Unrest follows the fatal shooting of a 17-year-old who failed to obey traffic police.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66038227,"– Paris police chief Laurent Nuez told French television station BFMTV that the policeman's actions ""raises questions"", though he suggested the officer may have felt threatened. The 17-year-old's family lawyer Yassine Bouzrou insisted that was an illegitimate defense, telling the same channel the video ""clearly showed a policeman killing a young man in cold blood."" Another lawyer representing the victim's family, Jennifer Cambla, told local media that nothing could justify what had happened, and described the death as an ""execution."" The shooting triggered a series of protests on Tuesday night in Nanterre, the area just west of Paris where the teenager was killed. Police initially suggested the teen drove his car towards them with the intention of hurting them. But footage posted online, verified by AFP news agency, tells a different story. It shows two officers trying to stop the vehicle. One points his weapon at the driver through the window and appears to fire at point-blank range as he tries to drive off. The agency also reports that a person in the video can be heard saying ""you're going to be shot in the head"" - but it is unclear who says it.

China crackdown pushes LGBT groups into the shadows It comes as the largest LGBT celebration in the country has been suspended since 2021.,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65806846,"– While celebrations were held around the world for Pride month, there were no major LGBT events in China. The country's largest Pride event has been suspended since 2021. The organizer, a group named ShanghaiPride, did not give a reason for the move, saying at the time it was ""cancelling all upcoming activities and taking a break from scheduling any future events."" People taking part in political protests in China often face punishment, so instead of holding parades, ShanghaiPride had organized dance parties, community runs and film screenings in the city. Now, only a few low-profile events are available for the LGBT community such as ""voguing balls"", where dancers execute moves inspired by model poses. ""With the closure of the Beijing LGBT Center, the last large LGBT organization in China has decided to take a break,"" Raymond Phang, the co-founder of ShanghaiPride, told the BBC. Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997 and the Chinese Society of Psychiatry stopped classifying it as a mental disorder in 2001. But space for LGBT advocacy has shrunk in recent years, along with a clamping down of civil rights movements and online dissent.",Negative
South Koreans become a year younger under new law Seoul scraps a centuries-old age-counting system in favour of international standards.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66028606,"– South Koreans have become a year or two younger as a new law aligns the nation's two traditional age-counting methods with international standards. The law scraps one traditional system that deemed South Koreans one year old at birth, counting time in the womb. Another counted everyone as aging by a year every first day of January instead of on their birthdays. The switch to age-counting based on birth date took effect on Wednesday. President Yoon Suk-yeol pushed strongly for the change when he ran for office last year. Previously, the most widely used calculation method in Korea was the centuries-old ""Korean age"" system, in which a person turns one at birth and gains a year on 1 January. This means a baby born on 31 December will be two years old the next day. A separate ""counting age"" system that was also traditionally used in the country, considers a person zero at birth and adds a year on 1 January. This means that, for example, as of 28 June 2023, a person born on 29 June 2003 is 19 under the international system, 20 under the ""counting age"" system and 21 under the ""Korean age"" system.",Positive
When Miss World in India threatened 'cultural apocalypse' The competition is being held in India for the first time since 1996 - when it sparked uproar.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-65903713,"– The Miss World pageant was organized in India by a company owned by Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan. According to reports, the firm hired more than 2,000 technicians, 500 dancers, and even 16 elephants for the event. But weeks before the show, violent protests broke out in Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore) city, the venue. Members of a women's organization threatened mass suicide, saying that competitions like Miss World would ""increase promiscuity and prostitution."" The contestants were sheltered from the controversy as much as possible—they were cooped up inside a luxurious five-star hotel for weeks with little outside contact. But almost three decades after the 1996 competition was also due to fears that ""middle class, upper-caste women""—who usually participated in these events—would be seen wearing swimsuits in public. In 2013, the final of Miss World was shifted from Indonesia's capital Jakarta to tourist haven Bali after weeks of protests from conservative Islamic groups—there too, the bikini round was scrapped, with contestants wearing ""modest, traditional Balinese sarongs.""",Negative
"Belarus leader welcomes Wagner boss into exile Yevgeny Prigozhin, who led a Russian mutiny, arrives in Belarus and his men are offered a military base.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66029636,"– The leader of Russia's 24-hour mutiny, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has arrived in Belarus, three days after his Wagner mercenary group's mutiny came to an end 125 miles south of Moscow.Mr Lukashenko said Wagner mercenaries had been offered an abandoned military base if they wanted to join their leader: ""There is a fence, everything is available, erect your tents."" Under the deal that brought an end to the mutiny, Mr Prigozhin has been promised security and the Russian criminal case against Wagner has been dropped.Whatever the truth of how 24 hours of mayhem did come to an end, one elaborate version was presented on Tuesday by Alexander Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus since 1994 and is widely thought to have rigged 2020 elections to maintain power.Mr Prigozhin also accused the Russian military of a missile strike on his men on Friday, killing 30 people.But then President Putin himself told an array of Russian security forces assembled in a Kremlin square that they had defended their motherland, ""de facto stopping a civil war in its tracks.""Mr Prigozhin's private army had been fully funded by the state, with $1bn spent on salaries and bonuses in 12 months.The mutineers' ease in seizing control of the city of Rostov-on-Don and then driving so far north with little opposition has exposed major weaknesses in the Kremlin's control of security in Russia after 23 years of Putin rule.",Negative
Cyclone survivors go hungry as junta blocks aid,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-65995101,"– Millions who survived one of Myanmar's strongest cyclones are now struggling to rebuild their lives after the government cut off access to affected areas, including for aid groups.The move has ""turned an extreme weather event into a man-made catastrophe,"" Human Rights Watch has said.Aid kept trickling in until 8 June, when Myanmar's army rulers, or junta as they are known, banned transportation for aid groups operating in the area, making it impossible for them to deliver aid.But a Rakhine government spokesman told local media that they wanted to manage the distribution of aid, which he claimed had not been administered fairly.This is a reference to the Muslim Rohingya community, the majority of whom live in Rakhine.The UN estimates that more than half a million of them still live in northern Rakhine, although many have fled the country because of persecution.Aid groups have not responded to the allegation, but told the BBC that the Rohingya's ethnicity could have played a role in the decision.It is certainly our experience that the Myanmar military puts significant barriers... [on our efforts] to help Rohingya and have actively diminished the human rights of the communities,"" said Claire Gibbons from Partners Relief & Development, a non-profit group that works in Myanmar.",Positive

Van life is far from glamorous on LA's streets,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66023691,"– It's one of many makeshift trailer parks in Los Angeles where a growing number of people live rough in vans and motorhomes with no access to running water or electricity. But a growing number pay rent— anywhere from $400-$1,000 (£314-£784) a month—to ""van lords"" who advertise motorhomes online. Many of the vans are inoperable and some don't even have motors. But the doors lock and they offer cheap shelter in neighborhoods where $2,000 a month often isn't enough for a studio apartment. The city is now considering a crackdown on van lords amid growing complaints about sewage, environmental damage, and a series of fires from the trailer parks. Los Angeles City Councilwoman Traci Park wants to crack down on the van lords, who are not required to meet the same standards and regular landlords, calling them ""unscrupulous.""",Negative
NYC's plan to slice pizza emissions causes backlash,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66027038,"– A proposal to slice emissions from coal and wood-burning pizza ovens in New York City by 75% has left a bad taste in the mouths of some locals. A rule change proposed on Friday would require pizzerias to evaluate whether they can install emissions control devices for their kitchens stoves. On Monday, a man tossed slices of pizza at New York City Hall in protest. ""Give us pizza or give us death,"" shouted conservative activist Scott LoBaido, in a reference to an anti-British Revolutionary War slogan. Pizzeria owners told New York news outlets that they expect to spend tens of thousands of dollars to install the emissions-trapping machines. But he added that the cost will need to be passed on to customers, saying: ""You know how many pizzas I have to sell to pay for that $20,000 oven?"" Paul Giannone, owner of Paulie Gee's in Brooklyn, told the New York Post that he has already spent $20,000 (£15,600) preparing for the new rule to take effect. The new rule proposed by the city's Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) will apply to coal and wood-fired ovens installed before 2016. Officials say it will affect less than 100 of the city's countless pizza joints.",Negative
Julian Sands: Free-spirited actor whose career started with a kiss,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-64346313,"– Actor Julian Sands, whose death has been confirmed five months after he went missing, was a magnetic presence on screen—whether playing romantic heroes in films like 1985's A Room With a View, like villains in TV's 24, or offbeat roles in cult releases. Sands earned a place in millions of hearts as the dashing George Emerson in A Room With a View. At one point in the Merchant Ivory epic, George perched precariously among the branches of an olive tree on an Italian hillside, listing life's most important things at the top of his voice: ""Beauty! Liberty! Joy! Love!"" His father, played by Denholm Elliott, explained matter-of-factly that George was simply ""declaring the 'eternal yes'."" Lucy Honeychurch, played by an 18-year-old Helena Bonham Carter, staggered into a field to trace the commotion. He strode through the tall barley and gathered her in a passionate embrace without saying a word. It was the scene that turned Sands into an idol for a generation, and helped make the Oscar-winning film a timeless romance. A Room With a View was one of Sands' first films, following parts in The Killing Fields and Oxford Blues. He then took projects that piqued his interest alongside those that paid his rent, portraying romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley in director Ken Russell's Gothic, and appearing in spider-filled thriller Arachnophobia and supernatural horror Warlock.",Positive
