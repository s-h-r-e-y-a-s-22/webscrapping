Spain's conservatives fall short of all-out victory Popular Party leader Alberto Núñez Feijóo narrowly wins but is held back by left-wing parties.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66285245,"– The leader of Spain's opposition conservative party Alberto Nez Feijo has claimed victory in a snap election, but without the result he needed. Even with the support of the far right, his Popular Party (PP) has fallen short of a majority in parliament. The cheers at the rival Socialist camp were just as loud as Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Snchez declared: ""The reactionary bloc has failed."" While both can claim success, Spain is left with an inconclusive result. But Mr Snchez has been vindicated in his controversial decision to call the vote in the searing heat of a Spanish summer, when election-day temperatures reached 40C in some parts of the country. Vox remains the third biggest party, with the support of three million of Spain's 37 million voters, but not significantly ahead of Sumar and with a big drop in seat numbers.",Positive
China school roof falls on volleyball team killing 11 Anguished parents have thronged a hospital seeking official updates on their children.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-66286576,"– Eleven people have died after the roof of a school gymnasium in north-east China collapsed while it was being used by a girls' volleyball team, state media reports. Many of the victims are children, eyewitnesses tell local media, although this is yet to be officially confirmed. Only eight of the 19 people who were inside the gym in the industrial province of Heilongjiang survived. A preliminary investigation found that perlite, a form of volcanic glass, had been illegally piled on the roof soaking up rain water, which caused the collapse at 15:00 local time (07:00 GMT). The coach of the middle school's girls' volleyball team was heard calling out the students' names as rescue teams clawed through the rubble in Qiqihar city, China National Radio reported. Parents questioned school officials, saying there had been a lack of proper communication on the rescue effort, which stretched until Monday morning.",Negative
Russia pummels Odesa after killing grain deal Russia is hammering Ukraine's port city of Odesa after quitting the grain deal. What happens now?,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66272001,"– Last week saw Moscow's official withdrawal. Last week saw Moscow's official withdrawal. Russia then launched a wave of missile strikes on ports it once promised to leave alone. In an article published on the Kremlin's website ahead of this week's Russia-Africa summit, President Putin wrote that ""Russia will continue its energetic efforts to provide supplies of grain, food products, fertilisers and other goods to Africa."" While global grain supplies seem to be stable for now, global markets saw the price of grain rise by 8% within a day of Russia pulling out—the highest daily rise since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February last year. The deal had allowed Ukraine to export its grain to the world through the Black Sea. Russia was accused of slowing the route with naval blockades and long inspections, and the deal finally succumbed. The city's mayor Gennady Trukhanov thinks Moscow just wants to show nothing will be exported without them, and he's right.",Positive

Afghan women mourn the end of beauty salons,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66271855,"– Beauty salons across Afghanistan will close in the coming weeks on the Taliban's orders. Their closure will lead to the loss of an estimated 60,000 jobs. Salons had been allowed to keep operating since the Taliban retook power two years ago, but it reversed its position last month. The decision further restricts spaces open to Afghan women, who are already barred from classrooms, gyms and parks. 23-year-old Zarmina was in a beauty salon getting her hair dyed dark brown when news of the approaching closures came through. ""The owner got a big shock and started to cry. She is the breadwinner for her family,"" the mother of two said. ""Now women only talk about unemployment, discrimination and poverty,"" Zarmina says.",Negative
‘My character isn’t being a palatable black man’,https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/e25eda29-a509-4673-a6ed-96e63e3db28c,"– In an episode of BBC Three's new comedy drama Dreaming Whilst Black, Kwabena is told by the head of a film industry diversity scheme that she deliberately starts screenings late because she's ""used to running on black man time."" This comment was an example of a microaggression—a comment or action that subtly and often unintentionally expresses a prejudiced attitude toward a member of a marginalised group (such as a racial minority). It reflects the real-life experiences of the writers room of Dreaming Whilst Black—and the experience of many people in real workplaces. In an episode of BBC Three's new comedy drama Dreaming Whilst Black, Kwabena is told by the head of a film industry diversity scheme that she deliberately starts screenings late because she's 'used to running on black man time.'""",Positive
Virginia Woolf's personal copy of debut resurfaces,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-66273443,"– Virginia Woolf suffered from severe mental health breakdowns during the estimated seven year period it took to complete The Voyage Out. She fell back into depression and was put in a nursing home the day before it was published in 1915, staying there for six months. Her husband Leonard Woolf said she was ""writing every day with a kind of tortured intensity"" to finish the novel. The University of Sydney said it appeared the rediscovered copy of The Voyage Out had been lost ""through the bustle of everyday campus and library life."" Simon Cooper, Metadata Services Officer from the Fisher Library, found the book incorrectly shelved in 2021. He said: ""I knew the book didn't belong there, so I took it out and then saw the author's name handwritten on the first page. So, I looked up her handwriting to compare it, and it matched."" The University acquired the book in the late 1970s through Bow Windows in Lewes, East Sussex. Woolf and her husband Leonard Woolf had lived in the area - and members of the public can still visit their 16th-century country retreat, Monk's House, which is owned by the National Trust, which is owned by a private collector based in London.",Negative

Man sets new 150-hour drumming world record,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-66258591,"– Allister Brown has twice before broken the world record for longest drumming marathon by an individual, first in 2003 when he drummed for 58 hours, and again in 2008 when he lasted just shy of 103 hours.

Why is technology not making us more productive?,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66233654,"– We are often told that we are in the midst of a technological revolution. That business and the world of work continue to be transformed and improved by computers, the internet, the increased speed of communication, data processing, robotics, and now—artificial intelligence. If all this technology really is making us all work faster and better, there is precious little evidence. Between 1974 and 2008 the UK's productivity—the amount of output you get per worker— grew at an annual rate of 2.3%. But between 2008 and 2020 the rate of productivity growth collapsed to around 0.5% per annum. And in the first three months of this year, UK productivity was actually down 0.6% on a year earlier. Nick Crafts is emeritus professor of economic history at the University of Sussex Business School. He points out that the huge sea changes in economic performance we tend to think of as having happened almost overnight, actually took decades, and the same may well be happening how. Dame Diane Coyle is the Bennett professor of public policy at the University of Cambridge, and a recognized expert on how we measure productivity. ""There is nothing that doesn't use digital now, but it is difficult to see what is going on because none of this is visible in the statistics. We just don't collect the data in ways that would help us understand what is happening."" For example, a company that used to invest in its own computer servers and IT department might now outsource both to an overseas, cloud-based provider.",Positive
