Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols The controversial police unit enforces Iran's strict dress code and has been accused of brutality.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-66218318,"– Iranian police are resuming controversial patrols to ensure women obey dress codes and cover their hair in public, state media reports. The ""morality police"" will return to the streets to enforce Iran's hijab laws, a spokesman said on Sunday. It comes 10 months after a young woman, Mahsa Amini, died in custody following her arrest in Tehran for allegedly breaking the dress code. Under Iranian law, which is based on the country's interpretation of Sharia, women must cover their hair with a hijab (headscarf) and wear long, loose-fitting clothing to disguise their figures. The morality police unit is tasked with ensuring those rules are respected, and detaining people who are perceived to be ""improperly"" dressed. During the patrols, officers will first warn women who are not complying with the rules, police spokesman Saeed Montazerolmahdi said, as quoted by hardline Tasnim news agency.",Negative

"Can US and China set aside rivalry for climate action? The two biggest economies and polluters need to work together to avert the crisis, experts say.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-66185535,"– John Kerry's office says he wants to engage with China on ""increasing implementation and ambition"" and ensuring a successful COP28, the UN climate change conference scheduled for the end of the year. But they are also the world's two largest carbon emitters, making them the ""G2 of energy consumption, energy use and pollution,"" noted Dan Kammen, energy professor at the University of California, Berkeley. The two countries are the biggest investors in renewable energy, with China alone making up more than half of the world's total renewable energy investment, according to one assessment. But they are also the world's two largest carbon emitters, making them the ""G2 of energy consumption, energy use and pollution,"" noted Dan Kammen, energy professor at the University of California, Berkeley. China has now shifted to prioritising its energy security. Last year, China approved a dramatic increase in its coal power output, the equivalent of approving two large coal power plants a week, according to one analysis. Analysts say Mr Kerry may try to persuade China to fully capitalize on its clean energy resources and achieve carbon neutrality more quickly. China aims to peak its carbon emissions by 2030 and become carbon neutral by 2060— goals which some say are too far off and give it too much leeway. Earlier this month Ms Yellen urged Beijing to donate to international climate funds set up by richer countries to help poorer economies struggling with climate change.",Positive

Why Hollywood actors have walked off set,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66208226,"– The last time both writers and actors manned the picket line, the strike lasted 10 weeks and was led by then-actor Ronald Reagan. But at the press conference announcing the strike, SAG's chief negotiator, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, explained why the union flatly rejected the idea.
