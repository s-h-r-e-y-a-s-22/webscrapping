Once the whales began beaching themselves on the shore, wildlife authorities launched an emergency response effort in a bid to save them. Some 51 whales died overnight on Tuesday, with authorities trying to return the surviving 46 to sea on Wednesday.

Some of Australia's worst mass strandings have involved pilot whales - 230 beached themselves on Tasmania's coast in 2022, and 150 were stranded in Western Australia in 2018.",Negative

Private 2nd Class King was last seen a week ago running across the demilitarised zone separating North and South Korea. The fate of Travis King, a US soldier who crossed into North Korea, remains unknown and experts say the US is at a critical stage to try and negotiate his return home.Mr Bergman, who has spent nearly 20 years negotiating to return US citizens from hostile nations, said the best chance at releasing a prisoner is right after they are detained.It is believed the 23-year-old soldier is being detained and questioned by North Korean authorities.Mr Bergman has worked alongside former New Mexico Gov Bill Richardson to secure the release of prisoners from countries hostile to the United States.Although the Richardson Center is not involved in the Travis King case, Mr Bergman said in his experience, when it comes to North Korea, there isn't a playbook for negotiations.The US has never officially held diplomatic ties with North Korea, during a detainee crisis, Sweden has served as an intermediary from their embassy in Pyongyang and has helped to relay communications to North Korean officials.Mr Bergman said it is unclear if the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang has returned to full capacity.North Korea completely closed its borders during the pandemic and Mr Bergman said it is unclear if the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang has returned to full capacity.The ban has remained in place under the Biden administration and has effectively ended humanitarian avenues for engagement, Mr Bergman said, because it allows negotiations to focus solely on the wellbeing and return of the detainee, instead of global politics.",Negative

July heat near impossible without climate change,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66289489,"– The North American heatwave was 2C (3.6F) hotter and the heatwave in China was 1C hotter because of climate change, the scientists concluded.

If temperature rise reaches 2C, which many experts warn is very likely as countries fail to reduce their emissions quickly enough, these events will occur every two to five years, the scientists say. The study also considered the role of El Nio, a naturally occurring powerful climate fluctuation that began in June. The study concluded that El Nio probably played a small part but that increased temperatures from burning fossil fuels was the main driver in the more intense heatwaves.",Positive
