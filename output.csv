Trump loses immunity in E Jean Carroll lawsuit Government lawyers say Mr Trump did not act within the scope of his duties when he disparaged E Jean Carroll.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66172116,"– The US Department of Justice has said. Its lawyers previously argued Mr Trump was legally immune as he was president when he made the remarks in 2019. But on Tuesday government attorneys said they no longer had ""sufficient basis to conclude Mr Trump had acted within the scope of his duties."" The decision boosts E Jean Carroll's defamation lawsuit against Mr Trump. In May, Mr Trump was ordered to pay the former magazine columnist $5m (£3.9m) after being found liable for sexual abuse of her in 1996 at a New York department store. Ms Carroll, 79, is currently seeking $10m from Mr Trump in a defamation lawsuit, which is due to go to trial in January. The lawsuit has been updated to reflect further comments he made about her during a CNN town hall the day after the court's verdict two months ago. The justice department had previously taken the position that Mr Trump could be defended by government attorneys because he was serving in his capacity as president when he made the remarks. But on Tuesday its lawyers said ""there is no longer a sufficient basis to conclude that the former president was motivated by'more than an insignificant' desire to serve the United States Government.""",Positive
How ripped ears are preserving a culture in Alaska Traditions of the hunt dating back centuries live on in the World Eskimo-Indian Olympics.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/66097710,"– The Native people of Alaska's coastal whaling settlements had a unique way of communicating when a hunt had been successful. Hundreds of years ago, the Native people of Alaska's coastal whaling settlements had a unique way of communicating when a hunt had been successful. On 12 July 2023, thousands will flock to watch the one and two-footed high-kicks, alongside events such as the ear pull, seal hop, and Indian stick pull, in the World Eskimo-Indian Olympics (WEIO) in Fairbanks, Alaska.

The games have also played a powerful role in both preserving Native Alaskan culture, helping younger people reconnect with their roots and helping those recovering from substance abuse.",Positive

Why Bollywood remains 'sexist and regressive',https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-66153598,"– Bollywood, India's hugely popular Hindi film industry, is often described as a man's world. It's something that's been talked about for a long time, but now a new study shows just how little gender equality there is—both on and off screen. The $2.1bn (£1.5bn) industry produces hundreds of films every year and has a massive following among Indians globally. The list of hits included War, Kabir Singh, Mission Mangal, Dabangg3, Housefull4 and Article 15 and the women-centric films included Raazi, Queen, Lipstick Under My Burkha and Margarita with a Straw, among others. The researchers studied nearly 2,000 on-screen characters to see the types of occupation actors played and analyzed the films over several parameters such as sexual stereotyping, consent and intimacy and harassment. They have concluded that though women-centric films give some reason for optimism, the box-office hits continue to be sexist and regressive and women and queer representation remains abysmal in them. For instance, 72% of characters in the films that were analysed were played by men, 26% by women and 2% by queer actors. Prof Lakshmi Lingam, the project lead for the study, says ""the big bucks are riding on all big men in Bollywood"" and the filmmakers say ""a very strong female character won't work with the audiences.""",Positive

Birds get revenge by using anti-bird spikes in nests,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66163943,"– Human-made objects being used in bird nests is nothing new—there is evidence of species around the world using everything from barbed wire to knitting needles—but now, it appears the birds are getting their own back. Dutch researchers have found that some birds use the spikes as weapons around their nests—using them to keep pests away in the same way that humans do. It shows amazing adaptability, biologist Auke-Florian Hiemstra says.Mr Hiemstra says the spikes were pointing outwards, creating a perfect armor around the nest.Mr Hiemstra says many more need to be found to further prove his theory, but there are several aspects to the nest architecture that suggest the birds are using the sharp spikes as protection.Mr Hiemstra started research in the courtyard of a hospital in Antwerp, Belgium, where an enormous magpie nest was found containing some 1,500 spikes.Mr Hiemstra says the spikes were pointing outwards, creating a perfect armor around the nest.Mr Hiemstra says the spikes were pointing towards the building—all that remained was the trail of glue.Mr Hiemstra says many more need to be found to further prove his theory, but there are several aspects to the nest architecture that suggest the birds are using the spikes as protection.Mr Hiemstra sees it as a ""beautiful revenge.""They are using the material that we made to keep them away, but humans aren't fans of these kinds of bushes and trees, so birds living in built up areas go for the next best thing, Mr Hiemstra says.",Positive
Syria aid lifeline facing closure after UN rift,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-66163612,"– Russia has threatened to end UN cross-border aid deliveries to millions of people in rebel-held north-west Syria, after the Security Council failed to pass two resolutions authorising them. Russia, an ally of Syria's government, vetoed a nine-month extension for the use of the Bab al-Hawa crossing that 13 of the 15 other council members backed. But it was then unable to muster enough votes for its proposal of six months. The US accused Russia of ""an act of utter cruelty."" Hundreds of lorries pass through Bab al-Hawa from Turkey every month with aid for 2.7 million civilians, who rely on it for food, shelter, and healthcare. The lifeline has become even more important since a devastating earthquake struck the region in February, killing more than 4,500 people and displacing 50,000 families. Although the Security Council decision means the UN must immediately stop aid deliveries through Bab al-Hawa, it will be able to continue until 13 August to use two additional border crossings that were opened with the consent of the Syrian government following the earthquake.",Negative
