"Extreme heat intensifies across south-west US In Phoenix, Arizona, temperatures have been above 109.4F (43C) for 17 days straight.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66218321,"– Death Valley in California hit 128F (53.9C) on Sunday, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). It is the site of the hottest temperature ever reliably recorded on Earth: 134F (56.7C). The usually crowded streets of Las Vegas were considerably emptier than normal on Sunday, with security guards guarding the fountains of upscale casinos and hotels to prevent people from jumping in. The Weather Channel has said the dome will expand across the nation's south by the middle of next week - meaning other southern US states will see temperatures rise. Elsewhere in the south-western US, hundreds of firefighters have been battling brush fires in blistering heat and low humidity on the outskirts of Los Angeles. A heat dome over the US south-west has translated into extreme heat warnings from coast to coast, which continue to affect more than 110 million people. Temperature records could be broken in as many as 38 cities.",Negative
Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols The controversial police unit enforces Iran's strict dress code and has been accused of brutality.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-66218318,"– Iranian police are resuming controversial patrols to ensure women obey dress codes and cover their hair in public, state media reports. The ""morality police"" will return to the streets to enforce Iran's hijab laws, a spokesman said on Sunday. It comes 10 months after a young woman, Mahsa Amini, died in custody following her arrest in Tehran for allegedly breaking the dress code. Under Iranian law, which is based on the country's interpretation of Sharia, women must cover their hair with a hijab (headscarf) and wear long, loose-fitting clothing to disguise their figures. The morality police unit is tasked with ensuring those rules are respected, and detaining people who are perceived to be ""improperly"" dressed. During the patrols, officers will first warn women who are not complying with the rules, police spokesman Saeed Montazerolmahdi said, as quoted by hardline Tasnim news agency.",Negative
Twitter loses half ad revenue since Musk takeover Elon Musk confirms the firm has a heavy debt load and income in June was not what had been expected.,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66217641,"– Twitter has lost almost half of its advertising revenue since it was bought by Elon Musk for $44 billion (£33.6bn) last October, its owner has revealed. He said the company had not seen the increase in sales that had been expected in June, but added that July was a ""bit more promising."" Mr Musk sacked about half of Twitter's 7,500 staff when he took over in 2022 in a effort to cut costs. Meanwhile, Twitter is struggling under a heavy debt load. Cash flow remains negative, Mr Musk said at the weekend, although the billionaire did not put a time frame on the 50% drop in ad revenue. In a tweet he said: ""Need to reach positive cash flow before we have the luxury of anything else."" Lucy Coutts, investment director at JM Finn, said: ""You wouldn't bet against him, he's a kind of mercurial figure and I think probably he will turn it around but it is just going to take longer.""",Negative
"Can US and China set aside rivalry for climate action? The two biggest economies and polluters need to work together to avert the crisis, experts say.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-66185535,"– John Kerry's office says he wants to engage with China on ""increasing implementation and ambition"" and ensuring a successful COP28, the UN climate change conference scheduled for the end of the year. But they are also the world's two largest carbon emitters, making them the ""G2 of energy consumption, energy use and pollution,"" noted Dan Kammen, energy professor at the University of California, Berkeley. The two countries are the biggest investors in renewable energy, with China alone making up more than half of the world's total renewable energy investment, according to one assessment. But they are also the world's two largest carbon emitters, making them the ""G2 of energy consumption, energy use and pollution,"" noted Dan Kammen, energy professor at the University of California, Berkeley. China has now shifted to prioritising its energy security. Last year, China approved a dramatic increase in its coal power output, the equivalent of approving two large coal power plants a week, according to one analysis. Analysts say Mr Kerry may try to persuade China to fully capitalize on its clean energy resources and achieve carbon neutrality more quickly. China aims to peak its carbon emissions by 2030 and become carbon neutral by 2060— goals which some say are too far off and give it too much leeway. Earlier this month Ms Yellen urged Beijing to donate to international climate funds set up by richer countries to help poorer economies struggling with climate change.",Positive

Why Hollywood actors have walked off set,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66208226,"– The last time both writers and actors manned the picket line, the strike lasted 10 weeks and was led by then-actor Ronald Reagan. But at the press conference announcing the strike, SAG's chief negotiator, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, explained why the union flatly rejected the idea.

But studio executives have said their demands are unreasonable, leaving Tinseltown at an impasse. Here's why Hollywood is on strike.",Negative
