What happens next as Hollywood grinds to a halt This is how a mega-strike involving writers and performers may see film and TV productions put on ice.,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-66196019,"– The last time members of the Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) walked out was in July 1980.

Forty-three years later, the new walkout - which joins an existing strike by writers - centers on similar demands relating to material made for streaming platforms and concerns over artificial intelligence. SAG-AFTRA said at a news conference on Thursday that the walkout will involve members on its 2020 TV and theatrical contract. Upcoming releases due to hold promotional events like press junkets and red-carpet premieres include Disney's Haunted Mansion (released 28 July), a new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film (2 August), Sir Kenneth Branagh's Agatha Christie mystery A Haunting In Venice (15 September).",Positive

At the time of Presley's death, local officials said first responders had been dispatched to her home in Calabasas, where they found her in cardiac arrest. The medical examiner's office said on Thursday that the cardiac arrest was caused by a ""small bowel obstruction.""

After her death, her mother, Priscilla Presley, filed a legal challenge to the will's validity, arguing that she was unaware of a 2016 amendment that had ousted her as a trustee overseeing Lisa Marie's estate.",Negative
The unlikely hit film that became a political flashpoint Critics have linked Sound of Freedom to QAnon conspiracy theories - a charge the filmmakers deny.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66169916,"– Sound of Freedom tells the story of a government agent who busts a child sexual abuse ring operating in Colombia. The main character is based on Timothy Ballard, a former Department of Homeland Security agent who founded an anti-human trafficking organization, Operation Underground Railroad (OUR). He goes undercover, and some of the gritty action scenes in the Colombian jungle wouldn't look out of place in a more conventional Hollywood flick. But this is not a typical summer blockbuster. A string of conspiratorial comments by the leading actor Jim Caviezel and the movie's themes have turned the film into another culture war flashpoint. Sound of Freedom tells the story of a government agent who busts a child sexual abuse ring operating in Colombia. Rolling Stone called it a ""QAnon-tinged thriller"" - a reference to the sprawling conspiracy theory that says that Donald Trump is fighting an elite cabal of satanic paedophiles.

He goes undercover, and some of the gritty action scenes in the Colombian jungle wouldn't look out of place in a more conventional Hollywood flick.

Republican rivals need Trump to debate. But will he? Polls show Donald Trump way ahead. His opponents hope that will change when debates begin next month.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66195481,"– Donald Trump has taken a commanding lead in the race to be the Republican presidential nominee for 2024. His opponents need to make a game-changing impression at the TV debates. First, each of the 14 candidates must gather enough donors and hit certain opinion polling metrics to qualify for the stage. But with Mr Trump threatening to skip the debates in order to preserve his huge lead, it is unclear how much these forums will influence the race. The first debate of the Republican presidential primary will be held on Wednesday 23 August, with a second possibly to follow the next night. The first one will take place in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which is also where the party will host its formal nominating convention next year. Wisconsin is a battleground state that the eventual Republican nominee will probably need to win at the November 2024 general election in order to get to the White House. Polls indicate a majority of Democratic voters, including those who support Mr Biden, want to see the nation's oldest ever president participate in debates as he seeks re-election.",Positive
