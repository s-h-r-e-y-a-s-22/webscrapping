Amsterdam bans cruise ships to limit visitors It comes months after young British men were urged not to hold bachelor parties in the Dutch capital.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66264226,"– Amsterdam's council has banned cruise ships from the city center as the Dutch capital tries to limit visitor numbers and curb pollution. Cruise ships had become a symbol of the problem of over-tourism, and the motion to move them out of the center passed by a large majority. Amsterdam has become a victim of its own popularity, attracting 20 million annual visitors - some drawn by its party city reputation. ""Polluting cruise ships are not in line with the sustainable ambitions of our city,"" the center-right party D66, which runs the city along with social democrats and environmentalists, said in a statement quoted by AFP news agency.",Positive
Drones are showing us sharks like never before Astonishing aerial footage reveals sharks are closer to us than we think – and usually leave us alone.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66252146,"– ""It's a full 180 degrees when you see the sharks in the wild,"" he said. But some experts said the technology is not particularly effective for monitoring sharks, as it only captures the fish during a limited part of their movements, when they swim close to the surface.

Roughly a dozen species of sharks swim off the coast of New York's Long Island, including sand tiger sharks, dusky sharks, sandbar sharks, while juvenile great white sharks have also been spotted in these waters. Gov. Kathy Hochul is sending drones to municipality officials to spot sharks near shore and order swimmers out of the water if needed. But some experts said the technology is not particularly effective for monitoring sharks, as it only captures the fish during a limited part of their movements, when they swim close to the surface.",Positive

"World will miss 1.5C warming limit, climate expert warns",https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66256101,"– A leading British climate scientist has told the BBC he believes the target to limit global warming to 1.5C will be missed. Professor Sir Bob Watson, former head of the UN climate body, told the BBC's Today program he was ""pessimistic."" His warning comes amidst a summer of extreme heat for Europe, China, and the US. The world agreed to try to limit the temperature increase due to climate change to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels at a UN conference in Paris in 2015. That target has become the centerpiece of global efforts to tackle climate change. Climate scientists have been warning governments for years that they are not cutting their countries' emissions quickly enough to keep within this target. But it is surprising for someone as senior and well respected as the former head of the UN climate science body the IPCC to be so frank that he believes it will be missed.",Positive
