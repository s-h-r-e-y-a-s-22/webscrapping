He went on to lead Russia's proxy army in the ensuing war in eastern Ukraine. Igor Strelkov was one of three men convicted in absentia by a Dutch court last November of murder for his role in a missile strike in 2014 that downed a Malaysia Airlines passenger jet over the conflict area, with the loss of all 298 people on board.

Strelkov's lawyer, Alexander Molokhov, said that after he had been detained his flat had been searched.

Drones are showing us sharks like never before,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66252146,"– ""It's a full 180 degrees when you see the sharks in the wild,"" he said. ""They're just chillin'."" In recent years, amateurs, photographers, some scientists, and even law enforcement have embraced drones as a way to study and track sharks, giving us an unprecedented view of one of the world's most infamous but least understood predators. The technology has resulted in stunning aerial images—great white sharks tearing at a humpback whale carcass, or floating peacefully just feet away from surfers. But drones are also exposing our unease with sharing the waters, and have sparked a debate about how the devices can best be used to protect the safety of beachgoers as encounters with the creatures increase. Roughly a dozen species of sharks swim off the coast of New York's Long Island, including sand tiger sharks, dusky sharks, sandbar sharks, while juvenile great white sharks have also been spotted in these waters. Gov. Kathy Hochul is sending drones to municipality officials to spot sharks near shore and order swimmers out of the water if needed.
