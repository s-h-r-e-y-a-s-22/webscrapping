"Bickering Nato aims for Ukraine unity as Putin watches on Nato faces a tricky summit focused on Ukraine as Kyiv presses to join the alliance, Katya Adler writes.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66135326,"– NATO is just hours away from its high-profile annual summit—a stress test for the alliance, with Russian President Vladimir Putin watching intently from the sidelines. With Joe Biden, Emmanuel Macron, Rishi Sunak, Olaf Scholz and so many more world leaders attending, ambassadors of the alliance's 31 member states have been huddled together, arguing about what they can, should or will announce publicly on Ukraine. The conundrum: How do you send Moscow a clear message that the West won't stand by and allow the Kremlin to grab sovereign territory in Ukraine or anywhere else in Europe, while at the same time avoiding coming into direct conflict with nuclear power Russia and risking all-out war? According to US President Joe Biden: ""I don't think there is unanimity in Nato about whether or not to bring Ukraine into the Nato family now, at this moment, in the middle of a war."" And 500 days into Russia's invasion, NATO's balancing act isn't getting any easier. Ukraine is clear. It wants an equal seat at the NATO table—with all the security guarantees that go with that—and it wants it now. Or, because it recognizes NATO can't admit a new member while that state is at war, it wants at least ""a clear signal that Ukraine will be in the alliance... not that the door is open for us, which is not enough, but that Ukraine will be in it.""",Negative
Top US senator calls for Prime Energy drink probe Chuck Schumer alleges the drink is being targeted at children despite its high caffeine content.,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66150857,"– Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has called on regulators to investigate an energy drink promoted by high-profile YouTubers KSI and Logan Paul.

Each drink carries a warning stating that it is not recommended for children under the age of 18. However, Mr Schumer alleged that Prime Energy was packaged and marketed ""in near identical form"" as a caffeine-free drink from the brand. As a result, some parents had unknowingly bought the caffeinated drink for their children, he told reporters in New York on Sunday.

Mapping these extreme hotspots are a vital asset to city planners as the world warms up and heat-related deaths continue to rise.",Positive
