Will found in Aretha Franklin's couch ruled valid A jury rules that a handwritten document found in Aretha Franklin's couch is a valid will to her estate.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66170679,"– A 2014 document found in Aretha Franklin's couch after her death is a valid will to her multi-million dollar estate, a jury has ruled. A two-day trial pitted the late Queen of Soul's children against each other in a battle over two handwritten versions of the singer's final wishes. Tuesday's verdict ends a nearly five-year legal squabble within the family. When Franklin died from pancreatic cancer in August 2018, it was widely believed she had not prepared a will to roughly $6m in real estate, cash, gold records and furs, or to her music copyrights. But, nine months later, her niece Sabrina Owens - the estate's executor at the time - discovered two separate sets of handwritten documents at the singer's home in Detroit. The 2010 document would see a more even distribution of Franklin's assets, but requires that Kecalf and another son Edward ""must take business classes and get a certificate or a degree"" in order to benefit from the estate. Kecalf and Edward have argued the newer document revokes the intentions of the older one, while their half-brother Ted White ""wants to disinherit"" them.",Negative
Trump loses immunity shield in defamation lawsuit Government lawyers say Mr Trump did not act within the scope of his duties when he disparaged E Jean Carroll.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66172116,"– The US Department of Justice has said. Its lawyers previously argued Mr Trump was legally immune as he was president when he made the remarks in 2019. But on Tuesday government attorneys said they no longer had ""sufficient basis to conclude Mr Trump had acted within the scope of his duties."" The decision boosts E Jean Carroll's defamation lawsuit against Mr Trump. In May, Mr Trump was ordered to pay the former magazine columnist $5m (£3.9m) after being found liable for sexual abuse of her in 1996 at a New York department store. Ms Carroll, 79, is currently seeking $10m from Mr Trump in a defamation lawsuit, which is due to go to trial in January. The lawsuit has been updated to reflect further comments he made about her during a CNN town hall the day after the court's verdict two months ago. The justice department had previously taken the position that Mr Trump could be defended by government attorneys because he was serving in his capacity as president when he made the remarks. But on Tuesday its lawyers said ""there is no longer a sufficient basis to conclude that the former president was motivated by'more than an insignificant' desire to serve the United States Government.""",Positive
"Far-right Finnish leader sorry in racism uproar Riikka Purra admits making the comments in 2008, while the PM vows no tolerance of racism.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66166795,"– Finland's far-right finance minister, Riikka Purra, has apologized for a string of racist comments she posted 15 years ago that have just come to light. Describing the posts as ""stupid"", she said she was sorry for the harm and resentment they had caused. Ms Purra's Finns Party secured high-profile cabinet posts in the new government of conservative Prime Minister Petteri Orpo. But in only three weeks it has been beset with accusations. It was a series of racist comments made on a party colleague's blog in 2008 that have stirred controversy, written under the username ""riikka"" and uncovered by Finnish media. One written on 25 September 2008 complained of young people of immigrant origin on a train: ""If they gave me a gun, there'd be bodies on a commuter train, you see."" She also referred to ""Turkish monkeys"" and then made a racial slur about black street hawkers selling ""fake Vuittons"" while she attended a conference in Spain: ""Greetings from Barcelona, there is no 'alarming immigration problem' to be seen here."" Initially she did not confirm the comments were hers but did point out that the comments had been written years before she entered politics.",Negative
Vermont suffers 'historic and catastrophic' floods More than 100 rescues have been carried out by swift boat crews in the deluged New England state.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66154757,"– Vermont has suffered ""historic and catastrophic"" flash flooding, its governor has said, after up to two months of rain fell in two days. More than 100 rescues have been conducted by emergency crews in boats in the New England state since the deluge began on Sunday. And over 100 roads across Vermont were closed on Tuesday because of the inundation. President Joe Biden declared a state of emergency on Monday in the state. Parts of the north-eastern US, including New York state, saw some of the most severe flooding in more than a decade in recent days. ""Make no mistake, the devastation and flooding we're experiencing across Vermont is historic and catastrophic,"" Governor Phil Scott told reporters on Tuesday. He added that the deluge in some parts of the state had surpassed that seen during Tropical Storm Irene in 2011, which killed six people in Vermont.",Negative
Is Bollywood a man’s world?,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-66153598,"– Bollywood, India's hugely popular Hindi film industry, is often described as a man's world. It's something that's been talked about for a long time, but now a new study shows just how little gender equality there is—both on and off screen. The $2.1bn (£1.5bn) industry produces hundreds of films every year and has a massive following among Indians globally. The list of hits included War, Kabir Singh, Mission Mangal, Dabangg3, Housefull4 and Article 15 and the women-centric films included Raazi, Queen, Lipstick Under My Burkha and Margarita with a Straw, among others. The researchers studied nearly 2,000 on-screen characters to see the types of occupation actors played and analyzed the films over several parameters such as sexual stereotyping, consent and intimacy and harassment. They have concluded that though women-centric films give some reason for optimism, the box-office hits continue to be sexist and regressive and women and queer representation remains abysmal in them. For instance, 72% of characters in the films that were analysed were played by men, 26% by women and 2% by queer actors. Prof Lakshmi Lingam, the project lead for the study, says ""the big bucks are riding on all big men in Bollywood"" and the filmmakers say ""a very strong female character won't work with the audiences.""",Positive

Why Threads brings back bleak and brutal memories,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-66122775,"– Threads was made and shown in an era of heightened tension between the West and the then USSR. ""I think '83, '84 was the peak of Cold War paranoia in the 80s,"" said Lawrence. ""You've got nuclear war mentioned in a million pop songs, you've got it on TV, in your comics, and then Threads comes on and there's every nightmare you've ever had on screen."" Brotherstone remembers feeling convinced he would not live to see 1990. ""I can still remember lying in bed in my bedroom and you can kind of see the next street on from my mum and dad's and it was almost like an overlaid image of blasted houses and rubble, because it affected me that much."" Reece Dinsdale, who played central character Jimmy in the film, said it had ""looked really special"" when he read the script, largely because he admired the work of writer Hines.

Caster Semenya wins appeal over testosterone limits,https://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/66162083,"– The European Court of Human Rights has ruled in favor of double 800m Olympic champion Caster Semenya in a case related to testosterone levels in female athletes. The 32-year-old South African was born with differences of sexual development (DSD) and is not allowed to compete in any track events without taking testosterone-reducing drugs. World Athletics has doubled down on its position in its efforts to protect fair competition in the female category, and is also keen for the Swiss courts to challenge the ECHR verdict. Semenya has twice failed in legal battles to overturn the decision. However, the case at the ECHR was not against sporting bodies or DSD rules - but specifically against the government of Switzerland for not protecting Semenya's rights and dates back to a Swiss Supreme Court ruling three years ago. World Athletics described the ECHR chamber as ""deeply divided"" and said it will ask the Swiss government to refer the case to the ECHR Grand Chamber for a ""final and definitive decision."" An ECHR statement said Semenya ""had not been afforded sufficient institutional and procedural safeguards in Switzerland"" to allow her to ""have her complaints examined effectively, especially since her complaints concerned substantiated and credible claims of discrimination as a result of her increased testosterone level caused by differences of sex development.""",Positive
Dumpling-eating race lands China eatery in trouble,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-66151245,"– China is investigating a restaurant over a dumpling-eating contest that allegedly flouts anti-food waste laws. But the viral challenge has ""misled"" people into ordering excessively, resulting in wastage, authorities say. China enacted laws in 2021 to tackle what leader Xi Jinping described as a ""shocking and distressing"" squandering of food. At least 34 million tonnes of food are wasted in Chinese restaurants every year, according to a 2020 survey conducted by China's national legislature. The eatery in Sichuan province is one of several under investigation for violating the laws. Eateries that ""induce or mislead customers to order excessively to cause obvious waste"" can be fined.",Negative
