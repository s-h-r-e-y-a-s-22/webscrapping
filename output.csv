Senior US commander says no contact with soldier The United Nations command says the man was on an organised tour when he crossed without permission.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66233797,"– North Korea is reported to have detained a serving US army soldier who crossed the heavily fortified border from South Korea without permission. The man was on an organized tour of the UN-run zone dividing the two countries. The Pentagon has identified the soldier as Private 2nd Class (PV2) Travis King. In a statement, a Pentagon spokesperson said that PV2 King had been in the army since January 2021. He is a cavalry scout - a reconnaissance specialist - originally assigned to an element of the army's 1st Armoured Division on a rotation with the US military in South Korea. The United Nations Command, which operates the Demilitarised Zone and joint security area (JSA), said earlier its team had made contact with the North Korean military to try to negotiate his release. It is unclear where or in what conditions PV2 King is being held. Greg Scarlatoiu, executive director of the Washington DC-based Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, told the BBC that North Korean authorities were likely to ""try pump information out of him"" about his military service and ""try to coerce him into becoming a propaganda tool."" Admiral John Aquilino Commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command said he was ""not tracking"" contact with North Korea.",Positive

New satellite photos reveal Wagner arrival A large convoy of suspected Wagner fighters has arrived at a new camp in Belarus.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-66234260,"– A large convoy of suspected Wagner fighters has arrived from Russia at a new camp in Belarus, new satellite images reveal. BBC Verify's analysis shows dozens of vehicles entering the camp at Tsel, a disused military base in southern Belarus - about 64 miles from the capital Minsk. The camp first appeared shortly after an agreement was reached to end Wagner's mutiny against the Russian military in late June. Part of the agreement reportedly involved Wagner troops agreeing to relocate to Belarus. The latest images suggest Wagner has now begun to move personnel in large numbers. Meanwhile, Wagner-linked channels on Telegram - a popular social messaging platform - have posted footage claiming to show the group's flags being lowered at its main training base at Molkino, in the southern Russian territory of Krasnodar. On Tuesday, the leader of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko - an ally of Russia - said Wagner ""are currently in their camps"" inside the country.",Positive

Kitchen shrine serpents and other new finds at Pompeii,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66226417,"– A kitchen shrine adorned with serpents, a bakery, human skeletons, exquisite frescos, and yes, a picture of something that looks very much like pizza.) Dig anywhere in the ancient city destroyed by Mount Vesuvius in AD79 and you will unearth an ancient treasure—a snapshot of a lost Roman world. It's extraordinary to think that one-third of the city buried under pumice and ash has yet to be excavated. BBC News has been given exclusive access to the investigation with Lion TV, which is making a three-part series to be aired early next year on the BBC. The latest work returns to a sector in the park last explored in the late 19th Century. Back then, archaeologists had opened up the frontage of houses on Via Di Nola, one of Pompeii's main thoroughfares, but hadn't delved far behind. Now, the diggers are progressively pulling away the volcanic ash and pea-sized stones, known as lapilli that smothered Pompeii during the two catastrophic days of the Vesuvian eruption.",Negative
